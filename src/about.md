<i>Worship Connected</i> is dedicated to helping families grow together in their faith through structured Bible reading and household worship (family devotions) connected to the weekly congregational worship of <a href="https://springsreformed.org/"  target="_blank">Springs Reformed Church</a>.
</div>

## Aim

These household worship guides are written to complement the Lord’s Day sermons at Springs Reformed Church by focusing the church members’ hearts, minds, and lives throughout the week on the preaching passage and connecting household worship with the church’s gathered worship.

## Family Worship Guide

Family worship doesn't have to be complicated. One father* put it this way:

The back of my shampoo bottle says, “Lather, rinse, repeat.” Simple enough that even I can do it. Though family worship may be a bit more complicated than sham-pooing hair, it ought not to be rated with “home dentistry” in the scale of difficulty.

If you could buy family worship in the store, it would come in the form of a Bible, and the directions would simply say, “Read, pray, repeat.” Men^ should gather their families at least once daily. They should read a portion of the Scriptures to them. And they should pray with them. There need be no fireworks or pizzazz to keep the kids interested. There needs to be only a father with a heart-love for God–who desires to see that love appropriated by his children. 

Read, pray, repeat.

<div><small><i>*What Shampoo and Family Worship Have in Common, written by Randy Greenwald, (Quoted from Tabletalk magazine, Nov 1997.)

^Fathers leading their family in worship is always the goal. When, in the Lord’s providence, the father is absent or uninterested, a godly mother will lead her children. In an extended household, mature members may share leading household worship.</i></small></div>
