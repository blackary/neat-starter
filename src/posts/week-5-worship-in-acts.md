The first church community. Focus on the four pillars of early church worship.

### Tuesday - Acts 4:23-31

Prayer in persecution. Reflect on how the early church turned to worship in difficult times.

### Wednesday - Acts 13:1-3

Worship and mission. Consider how worship leads to sending and service.

### Thursday - Acts 16:25-34

Paul and Silas in prison. Meditate on worship in unlikely places.

Breaking bread together. Think about the connection between communion and worship.
