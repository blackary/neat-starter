### Reading

Luke 14:25–35—The Cost of Following Jesus.

### O﻿ptional Reading

Joshua 5

### Notes

It might seem at times, from a human perspective, that Jesus needed a better PR manager. Luke gives us the account that great crowds were following Jesus. Humanly speaking, it would seem best to encourage those crowds and seek to draw more. But here, and often, Jesus challenges the crowds in such a way that they might be less inclined to follow him, and even to turn away from him (see John 6:66). But as important as following Jesus is, Jesus makes clear that it comes at great cost. A cost, to be sure, that’s worth it. But a cost nevertheless.

As Hendriksen notes, Jesus tells the people that devotion to himself must be so wholehearted that even attachment to parents and to the other members of one’s family must not be allowed to stand in the way. … Wholehearted devotion, all-out loyalty, complete self-denial, so that one places himself, his time, his earthly possessions, his talents, etc., at the disposal of Christ, is what Jesus asks.

It is this concept of wholehearted devotion that drove Joshua, in Joshua 5, to worship as God commanded and to prepare as carefully as possible. But ultimately he (and we) must submit to the commander of God’s army—Jesus..

### Questions

2. What is the value of being Jesus’s disciple?
3. How might Jesus be calling you to submit to him at this point in your life?
