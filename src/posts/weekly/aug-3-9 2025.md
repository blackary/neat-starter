W﻿e look back on 1 Thessalonians 5:12-15 on L*aws for Love in the Church* as well as Genesis 28:10-22 on *A Ladder from Heaven* and forward to *Resources for Renewal* from 1 Corinthians 1 and *Steadfast Living in Unsteady Times* from 1 Corinthians 16:13-14 on with our guest preachers.

D﻿ates might be wonky this week with the dramatic time difference between COS and NZ. Hopefully you can figure it out.
