W﻿e look back on *Moses' Encounter With God and the Burning Bush* and we look forward to the *Humiliation and Exaltation of Christ* and the *Biblical Faith of Timothy* and forward to *Mercy in Judgement* from 2 Chronicles 26. However, since we did a look forward to 2 Chronicles 36 a couple of weeks ago, we will consider the three themes of Worship Connected--Family worship, Responding to the Word Preached, and Delighting in the Sabbath.
