This week we'll be diving into the early chapters of John's Gospel, focusing on Jesus' first signs and teachings that reveal His divine nature.

## Daily Reading Plan

### Monday - John 1:1-18

The Word became flesh. Reflect on Jesus' divine nature and His purpose in coming to earth.

### Tuesday - John 2:1-25

The wedding at Cana and cleansing of the temple. Consider Jesus' authority and how He reveals His glory.

### Wednesday - John 3:1-21

Nicodemus and being born again. Meditate on what it means to be born of the Spirit.

### Thursday - John 4:1-42

The Samaritan woman at the well. Think about Jesus breaking down social barriers and offering living water.

### Friday - John 5:1-15

Healing at the pool of Bethesda. Focus on Jesus' compassion and power to heal.

## Discussion Points
