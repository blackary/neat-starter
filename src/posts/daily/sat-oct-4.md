### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *fight* and *weapons*.

### Reading

1 Timothy 1:18-19—Fight the Good Fight

### Optional Reading

Psalm 18

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* The Christian life is a war.
* Our enemies are the world, our own flesh, and the devil.
* We must fight a good fight in the Christian life.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How do you know if You are fighting the good fight?
2. What are some areas of the good fight today?
3. How doe God arm you for the good fight?

### Notes

(See below for all authors)	

The Christian life is a war. Like Timothy, we must wage the good warfare. What you believe is not trivial. How you live is not indifferent. We must hold onto faith and cling to the gospel. We must live with a good conscience. Robinson defines the conscience as a sensitivity God gives to people which enables them to discern the difference between right and wrong.

Some have lost the battles. When we disregard good doctrine, genuine faith, and a clear conscience, we have lost that battle. Whenever we sin, we have lost that particular battle. Every sin, no matter how trivial we consider it, is a victory for Satan.

So, is our only hope for winning the battles and the war our sincere faith and good conscience? No! Paul has alluded to it in v15-17. Our Commander has won. So, we fight on His side and we follow Him. We follow His doctrine—learning everything He has commanded. We follow His life—living in obedience to God as He did. And, we do the good works He saved us to do.
