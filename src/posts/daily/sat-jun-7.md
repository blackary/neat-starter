* The wicked rebel against God’s rules.
* God laughs at the wicked.
* God’s son, Jesus, reigns as King.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How do the wicked rebel against God?
2. Why does God laugh at the wicked?
3. How should we respond to God’s anointed King, Jesus?

### Notes

Psalm 2 begins the same way Psalm 1 ends—with a description of the wicked. These verses don’t describe their end condition (that will come in v12) but rather their rebellion against God. Spurgeon says *we have in these first three verses, a description of the hatred of human nature against the Christ of God*. But we do well to consider God’s response to them.

God laughs. Three different times in the Psalms God laughs at the wicked (2:4, 37:13, 59:8). When we see them apparently prospering, we need not fear that they will succeed. Even if it is not yet the time of God’s judgment on them, it is the time of God’s laughter and scorn for their rebellion.

But not only will God laugh at them, He will speak to them in His wrath. And His message is, “My King reigns!” Who is this great King of Glory? He is the beloved, begotten, Son of God. The New Testament makes clear that this Psalm is about Jesus.

Jesus is reigning now. Christ is even now subduing God’s enemies. And so we call on those who are in rebellion against God and His Christ to instead lovingly submit to King Jesus. We do so with the confidence that God has given the nations to His beloved Son.
