* We should be quick to listen.
* We should be slow to speak.

2. Why should we be slow to speak?
3. Why should we be slow to become angry?

### Notes

(See last page for authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on James by Gordon Keddie)	

*The new Christian is a novice. He naturally wants to talk about his new faith, his new hopes and his new Saviour. But he must rather be as quick to listen. He must restrain his quickness to speak out. He must open his ears rather than his mouth! This principle applies to every Christian, of course, the point being that the Word of God must first be heard before anyone can respond in faith to its claims. … At the heart of it is the humble realization of the need to learn and the concomitant awareness that if I’m endlessly spouting my ignorance, I can’t be absorbing your wisdom … or the Lord’s.*


*As with all things there must be balance and proportion. It is not wrong to speak! Some folk are so quiet they never say a word; others are never silent. What James has in mind is a sensitivity to the dangers of speaking too hastily or too passionately.*


*Anger very often wells up in connection with both poor listening and hasty speaking, but it is a problem in its own right. … Only a quiet and calm spirit produces personal holiness. Steady perseverance and patience, not agitation and anger, are the hallmark of the work of God in human hearts (Romans 5:3–5). … These \[basic elements in any cultivation of a Christ-like attitude to spiritual things] will, in Jesus Christ, bring forth the righteous life that God desires.*
