### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *king* and *he* or *his*.

### Reading

Zechariah 9:9-13—Behold Your King

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Zechariah calls his readers to pay attention to their King.
* This King is clearly Jesus.
* King Jesus has righteousness and salvation.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How do we know Zechariah is speaking of King Jesus?
2. What are we told about King Jesus?
3. How do we see and pray for Jesus’s rule of the whole earth?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.)	

Webb states that *verse 9 is undoubtedly the best-known verse in Zechariah, and one of the better-known verses of the entire Old Testament. … the king is a man, a human being—but a man who is closely associated with God. And who is the man most closely associated with God? Jesus, the God-man is this man*.

The New Testament helps us know for sure that this promised King is Jesus himself. “Tell the people of Jerusalem, ‘Look, your King is coming to you. He is humble, riding on a donkey— riding on a donkey’s colt’” (Matthew 21:5 NLT). “Don’t be afraid, people of Jerusalem. Look, your King is coming, riding on a donkey’s colt” (John 12:15 NLT). What are we told about King Jesus here?

He is righteous. The only hope we have for righteousness is His righteousness granted to us by faith.

He has salvation. The granting of His righteousness to us is His saving work. 

He will rule the whole earth. The promised extent of the reign of King Jesus is given repeatedly in the Bible (e.g. Psalm 72:8, Matthew 28:18, 1 Corinthians 15:25). Is He your King?
