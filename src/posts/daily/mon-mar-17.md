### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *sowed* and *seed*.

### Reading

Matt 13:24-28, 36-39—Two Seeds Sown, Plants Grown

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus tells about two seeds.
* Jesus tells about two plants.
* Jesus tells about two harvests.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What were some (or all) of the comparisons Jesus made?
2. Who were the two sowers?
3. Why can’t the weeds be pulled up?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on Matthew by Iain D. Campbell)	*Jesus tells another story about sowing. In the first, only a small percentage of the seed fell onto good ground. In this parable, even the good seed is compromised. As the result of a covert operation by an ‘enemy’ of the sower, the field is sown with weeds among the wheat. To the suggestion that the servants go into the field to take out the weeds, the master says, ‘No; you could root up the good growth with the bad. We will separate them at harvest time.’
Jesus makes the following point-by-point comparison:
  	Element of story	Spiritual meaning
  	Sower	  		Son of Man   (i.e. Jesus himself)
  	Field			The world
  	Good seed		Children of the kingdom
  	Weeds			Children of the evil one
  	Enemy			Devil
  	Harvest			End of the world
  	Reapers			The angels
The comparisons are skilful and simple, and the message is that, in the experience of the kingdom of God in the world, the children of God and the children of the devil co-exist, without separation, until the end of the world comes.* 

*Jesus is the eternal king!*
