### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

Yesterday we heard the bad news: we were dead in trespasses and sins and in the hands of an angry God. But we need the bad news because without it, the good news isn’t all that good. What need does a good person have for a savior? In Jesus’s words, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick” (Mark 2:17).

We were dead in trespasses and sins and in the hands of an angry God—but God. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ. Our sin may be great, but God shows us here that His love is even greater. “But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom. 5:8) This is a great gift, one that we don’t deserve! And what do we do? We receive it by faith, and the blood of Jesus cleanses us of all our sins. Praise God for His inexpressible gift!
