* God’s glory filled the tabernacle and temple.
* God’s glory fills Jesus’s church.
* The more we look at Jesus, the more we look like Jesus.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How was God’s glory seen in the Old Testament?
2. How is God’s glory seen in Christians today?
3. How is it that we are transformed into the image of Jesus?

### Notes

In the temple Solomon built, the Lord’s glory filled the temple so significantly that the ministering priests could not stand in the temple—apparently until a measure of this cloud of glory faded away. This cloud of glory was a visible sign of God’s always-presence. That glory was seen in Jesus (John 1:14) in his earthly life and ministry. And now, amazingly, that glory is seen in Jesus’s people—in his church!

That glory is in us, Jesus’s people, as God transforms us more and more into the image of his beloved son. We are being transformed. And it is visible!

Casto notes that *as we behold the Lord in his glory, a transformation happens, which changes us into the same image that we are beholding. … This transformation is not just for a few Christians, but rather for all who turn to the Lord and who have had the veil removed. We are all being transformed into the same image we are beholding. What image is that? The image of the glory of God, the very image of Jesus*.

Oh, that when others look at me, they might see the image of Jesus! Oh, that when I look into the mirror of my heart, I might see, more and more, the image of Jesus!
