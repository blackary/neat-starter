### *Listen up, little ones*

1 Corinthians 11:23-34—The Lord’s Supper

* Jesus gives us the Lord’s Supper.
* In the first Lord’s Supper, Jesus took bread.
* The bread signifies Jesus’s body.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How many significant acts are described in our text?
2. What is the first significant act?
3. What is significant about this act?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are taken from the Young People's manual of RPCNA) *We see in the words of institution, given by Christ to the apostle Paul, the reasons and instructions for the Lord's Supper.  Notice the beauty and simplicity of the passage.  It specifics six significant acts, which should be understood as we come to the table.* 

 *First, he took bread—that was a significant act.  It signified that he, the son of God, had come from heaven and taken a human body like ours to dwell in while on earth.  Taking the bread, He said, "This is my body."  This act indicates that he took a body and came in the likeness of sinful flesh when he was born at Bethlehem.  It sets forth what we call the doctrine of the incarnation—that the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us.  He took bread; he became one of us by taking our nature.*
