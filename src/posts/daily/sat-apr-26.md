* We are to observe the Sabbath.
* We are to do (celebrate) the Sabbath.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Do you look forward to the Lord’s Day each week? Why/Why not?
2. How can we remember the Sabbath?
3. How can we observe the Sabbath?

### Notes

*Friday’s here. Jump and cheer. Shabbat is coming. … Hurray! Shabbat is here!*  So begins the children’s book, Shabbat is Coming! Do we have that attitude about Sunday, the Lord’s Day? It’s Thursday, Sunday’s coming! *It’s Friday, Sunday’s coming soon! It’s Saturday, Sunday is tomorrow! Hurray, it’s the Lord’s Day! Sunday is here!*

The Exodus account of the fourth commandment uses the Hebrew word *zākar* that is translated *remember* most of the time. The Deuteronomy account uses the Hebrew word *šāmar* that is usually translated *keep, guard, or observe*. According to the TWOT, the basic idea of the root is *to exercise great care over*.

There does seem to be, in the words our LORD used, a slight difference in emphasis that some others have noted. *Remember*, of course has a backward look. And the Deuteronomy account also includes remembering, *You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt* (Deut. 5:15). *Observe*, however, tends to point forward. I think it’s reasonable to conclude that the *observing* in Deuteronomy is complementary to the *remembering* in Exodus. One is to look back, remembering the Sabbath past, even as one prepares to observe the Sabbath to come.
