* Joel tells of great promises of God.
* Peter tells us in Acts 2 that God kept these promises.
* God always keeps his promises.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What did Joel promise God would do?
2. How did these things take place in Acts 2?
3. What happens to those who call on the name of the Lord?

### Notes

(See below for all authors)	

Joel tells his readers of God’s promise to pour out his Spirit (God, the Holy Spirit). Acts 2:17-21 quotes this promise as being fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost in Jerusalem. 

As the Holy Spirit filled the believers on that day, they suddenly had the ability to speak in the various languages of the international Jews gathered there. Many of these Jews had begun to gather where the disciples were. Some of the scorners supposed the sounds they were hearing from these Spirit-filled believers were drunken gibberish. Don’t unknown languages sometimes sound like that to you? Instead, this was God keeping his promise.

We are reminded here in Joel and in Acts that God always keeps his promises. As Prior comments, *if the promises of God in Joel’s generation can be summarized in the words ‘I will pay back …’, his promises for some later time can be expressed in the words ‘I will pour out.’* 

This great and remarkable Day of the Lord, Calvin says, *begins this day at the first preaching of the gospel, and… extends the same unto the last resurrection*. From this day until the end of time, everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
