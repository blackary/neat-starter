* It’s hard to wait.
* Often when we wait, we ask, How long?
* We don’t know, but we can trust God who does know.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What did the Psalmists ask How long about?
2. What have you asked How long about?
3. How long did Jesus face God’s wrath?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.)

How long? Though God often asks this question of His people, we also have God’s people asking, *How long*, of God. *How long do I have to live in these troubles?* *How long will You hide your face from me* (Ps 13:1-2)? *How long will You look on and not rescue me* (Ps 35:17)? *How long? Will You be angry foreve*r (Ps 79:5)? *How long will You be angry with your people’s prayers* (Ps 80:4)? *How long? Will You hide forever* (Ps 86:46)? *How long will we wait for Your compassion* (Ps 90:13)? *How long will the wicked celebrate* (Ps 94:3)? In addition to the Psalms, we see the lament in the prophets (Isa 6:11, Jer 31:22, Hab 1:2, Zech 1:12). We hear also from the martyred saints in our optional reading (Rev 6:9-11).

God does not rebuke His people for that lament. He also does not usually answer. This lament, included in our text today, is a lament of faith. And it is a lament our Savior knows.

Ash notes that when *Jesus calls out in the shadow of the cross, “Now is my soul troubled” (John 12:27), he echoes Psalm 6:3. Here is a window into his heart…. \[God’s anger] felt like an eternity of agony as he cried, “How long?” No wonder his soul was troubled (cf. Matt. 26:38), until he declared, “It is finished!” (John 19:30).*

We may not know how long. But we know our God hears.
