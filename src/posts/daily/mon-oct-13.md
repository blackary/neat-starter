### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

John 3:16 is probably the best-known verse in the Bible. And it is a wonderful verse. It tells us about the extent of God’s love and the way to be saved. But it is given in a context. And in that context, there are two end results—salvation, or condemnation. 

Like the warning given by Joel of God’s judgment, John 3:16 comes as a hopeful offer right alongside a warning of God’s judgment. As Barnett reflects, *people either believe in the Son of God or not and they ‘come to’ the light or shy away from it. There is promise here, but also warning.*

For any and all who don’t believe, God’s judgment is certain. Interestingly, both in v18 and in v 36, we are clearly told that God’s judgment or God’s wrath remains on those who don’t believe and obey the Son of God. 

In other words, all people born in this world are under God’s judgment. And the only escape from that judgment is to believe in Jesus, whom God the father sent into the world. And that escape is possible because God loved the world and sent his son. If you haven’t, flee from God’s wrath and judgment. IF you have, rejoice in God’s love and your Savior’s pardon.
