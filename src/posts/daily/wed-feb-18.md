### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

“Jesus wept” (Jn 11:35) is a well-known, short, glimpse into the tears of Jesus. Ash notes that *we wonder at Jesus’s tears. Psalm 6 gives us a window into the grief of Jesus’s spirit as the shadow of our sin falls on his sinless soul. Psalm 6:6–7 fills out the tears of Hebrews 5:7. Now we know that when Jesus wept over Jerusalem (Luke 19:41), those tears were but the visible few from an ocean of weeping, night by night on earth. As the Son of God faces the hostility of a sinful world whom he has been sent to save, he weeps and weeps and weeps. Luther comments that “such was the ardor of \[the Lord’s] spirit, that if He had had so many tears in His head that they would have been enough to wash His bed, He would surely have poured them out.”*

If our Lord mixed tears with His prayers, surely we can too! And we likely have. The alternative is often just tears, or tears and anger, or tears and depression. Instead, like Jesus, we can weep and pray. God, who Jesus knew was able to save Him from death, can save us from, or through, the hard circumstances that lead us to pray with tears. 

Jesus wept. You can weep too. But don’t forget, Jesus also prayed. And you must pray too.
