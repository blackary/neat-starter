1. How does grace humble every believer?
2. How does grace give hope to every believer?
3. How does grace enable you to serve the Lord?

### Notes

(See last day for authors.)	

Our text starts with a rare prayer from Paul—rare because it is directed to Jesus. Paul thanks Jesus for enabling his faithful service, for showing mercy to wicked sinners, and for His amazingly abundant grace—His super abounding grace. This is an expression Paul uses over and over (you could say, Paul was super abounding with describing God’s work as super abounding).

In response to this super-abounding grace, we respond with faith and love. Hendriksen notes that *grace is ever the root, faith and love are the trunk, and good works are the fruit of the tree of salvation*. So, if we accept this reliable statement that Jesus came to save wicked sinners like me, then we too can and must believe on Him for eternal life. We must have personal faith in Jesus, not merely intellectual acceptance. Not just *I believe Jesus died for sinners*, but *I believe Jesus died for me, the sinner*. And with that belief, eternal life. Jesus doesn’t offer a *limited* lifetime warranty where we might hear, *sorry, that’s not covered*, but rather eternal life, lasting forever. And our response is to forever praise our Savior and King.

Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. Trust in Christ's love and work to give you the hope of salvation that Paul had, and to give you confidence to serve Him.
