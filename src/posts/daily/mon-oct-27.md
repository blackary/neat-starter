### *Listen up, little ones*

Listen for the word *good*.

### Reading

Romans 8:28-30—Good vs. Evil

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* In heaven everything will be perfect.
* We are not in heaven yet.
* But God works good in everything for Christians even now.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Is everything that happens good?
2. What does God do in all things for Christians?
3. Can you think of an example where God worked bad for good?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are taken from a devotional on Romans by R.C. Sproul)	

*We know from the teaching of Scripture that our ultimate destiny as Christians is to enter into heaven, a place, we are told in the book of Revelation, where there will be no night, no death, and no tears. In heaven we will live forever without affliction and pain. The environment of heaven will never be marred by the presence of evil or sin. Heaven is a place where nothing goes wrong and no evil takes place.* 

*What about now? We are not in heaven. We are still in a vale of tears. How would we feel if Jesus walked in the door and spoke directly to us, saying, “I have good news for you: I promise that nothing bad will ever happen to you again”? In a very real sense, He has already said that, although He does so in a sideways manner. It is basically the affirmation that we are given here in Romans 8:28. Paul says with assurance, And we know . . . He is not speaking with the editorial we or the magisterial we; he is speaking inclusively of all who are in the faith. The one thing that all true believers know for sure is that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose (v. 28). Paul gives us an astonishing affirmation when he says with certainty that all things are working together for good for those of us who love the Lord and who are the called according to His purpose.*
