* David wanted to build God’s house.
* God said He would build David’s house.
* David’s son will build God’s house.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why did David want to build God’s house?
2. What did Nathan tell David (first, next)?
3. Who is David’s son?

### Notes

What is a covenant? It is a solemn promise between two or more parties. Covenants in the Bible are made especially between God and people. The significant difference in God’s covenant with people is that the two parties are not equal. So, God determines the terms of the relationship. Witsius defines God’s covenant with people as *an agreement between God and man, about the way of obtaining consummate happiness; including a \[divine threat] of eternal destruction, with which the \[scornful rejector] of the happiness offered in that way, is to be punished.*

In our text, God makes a covenant promise with David. David had desired to build God’s house, but God instead said that he would build David’s house. In fact, God said that he would build an eternal kingdom from David’s son. This eternal king will be God’s own son. Goldsworthy suggests that t*he expression, ‘I will be his father, and he will be my son’ (7:14) ought to be understood as ‘an individualizing of the covenant statement, “I will be your God and you shall be my people.”*

As we keep reading the Bible, we find that God’s promise with David and his promise of an eternal king are about the way we can obtain complete and eternal happiness.
