### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What has God warned will happen to Jerusalem?
2. What three things did God show Jeremiah?
3. What happens when you turn from your sin and call on God?

### Notes

As we return to working through the Old Testament books, we come to Jeremiah. Jeremiah’s prophesies take place about 60 years after the end of Isaiah’s prophecy. Jeremiah has told Judah in the preceding chapters of God’s pending judgment on Jerusalem and the need for God’s people to seek the good of the city to which God would carry them. Even though God will bring judgment as he promised on his unfaithful people, Jeremiah has reminded them of God’s New Covenant blessings to come.

Here in our text, God again promises judgment. Yet he reminds Jeremiah that he is available for us to call on him. Call and he will answer. His promised answer included at least three things. First, the promise of the defeat of God’s enemies. This judgment is all the sadder given that God’s enemies here are his own people who continue to reject God and his word.

Secondly, there is a promise of forgiveness. As wayward as his people have been, God’s faithful covenant love will be poured out for his repentant people. Their guilt will be cleansed, their sins will be forgiven. If you are rebelling against God, turn. Repent and be forgiven!

Finally, there is the promise of lasting peace for God’s forgiven people. Instead of sorrow, there will be joy and gladness—like a wedding ceremony. Call to God and ask him to show you great things.
