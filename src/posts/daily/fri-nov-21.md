### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *joy* and *endured*.

### Reading

Micah 5:5-9—The Remnant of Jacob Rescued

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Assyria will come to invade Israel and Judah.
* The promised Shepherd-King will bring hope.
* The faithful few left of God’s people will help bring rescue.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What role would Assyria have against Israel? Judah?
2. What is the significance of the remnant being like dew?
3. What is the significance of the remnant being like a lion?

### Notes

(See last day for authors.)	

Assyria is coming! Fee and Stuart note that *Assyria is a constant threat on the international scene as she begins reasserting her power in the Near Eastern world...Thus Assyria looms large in Micah, but her role is ambivalent: Although she is God's agent of judgment on Samaria (1:6-7, 10- 16), she will fail against Judah (5:5-6) and will eventually experience God's judgment (5:15; 7:10)*. The promised Shepherd-King, even before His coming, will bring hope when Assyria invades so that “under-shepherds” will be God’s agent of rescue against Assyria.

Calvin comments that *when the Assyrians shall pass through the land and tread down all the palaces, God would then become the deliverer of his people. It might have been objected, and said, “Why not sooner? …But we see the manner in which God intends to preserve his Church: for as the faithful often need some chastisement, God humbles them when it is expedient, and then delivers them*.

Smith notes that *a second way Messiah would prove himself to be peace for his people is by empowering them to overcome their enemies. Two figures are used to convey the result of the work of the redeemed among the unbelieving nations. 1. The refreshing dew (5:7). The message of salvation falls like dew or showers from heaven on the barren hearts of the heathen. 2. The rending lion (5:8–9). The remnant may bring a refreshing message to the nations, but that remnant would be anything but feeble*.
