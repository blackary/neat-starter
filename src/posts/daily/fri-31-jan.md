### Reading

John 21—Faith Moving Forward

### Notes

<div><small><i>Today’s notes are from a commentary on John by R.C. Sproul).</i></small></div>

*This conversation \[between Peter and Jesus] took place a little more than thirty years before Peter met his death at the hands of Nero in Rome. Tradition says that Peter was crucified upside down. John says these cryptic words of Jesus here—“you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you”—were Jesus’ prophetic forecast for how Peter’s life would end. Nevertheless, Jesus said to Peter, “Follow Me,” and despite this Sword of Damocles hanging over his head for thirty years, Peter did just that. He followed Jesus and he fed the Lord’s sheep.*

*The disciple whom Jesus loved, John himself, apparently heard the exchange between Jesus and Peter. He seems to have been nearby, and Peter, seeing him, said, “Lord, what about him?” It’s not clear what Peter was asking, but let’s assume Peter asked, “You have told me what’s going to become of me; what’s going to happen to John?” History tells us that John was the only one of the apostles who was not martyred for the faith, though he did not escape persecution, for he was exiled to the island of Patmos.*

*As is so often the case, Peter was a picture of us when he asked this question. If the Lord gives me one thing, I think everybody should get it, or if you get something I don’t get, I say, “What’s the matter with me? Why didn’t I get it?” The Lord has jobs for each of us to do, and what others do is ultimately none of our business. Each of us must do what God has given him or her to do, and fulfill the mandate of Christ*.
