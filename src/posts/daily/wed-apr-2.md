### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Since God is for us, who can be against us?
2. What will God do for us in Jesus?
3. What happens when the Christian dies?

### Notes

If God is for us, who can be against us?  We should understand this, since God is for us. Many are against Christians, but man can’t do anything except what God allows. This gives us great hope in the face of persecution. We sometimes say, “If it doesn’t kill me, it will make me stronger.” Yet in Christ, even if it kills me, it makes me stronger because to die and be with Christ is better by far. Osborne comments that *the implications are enormous. Every time Satan conquers the saints by killing them, they conquer him by being killed. Their seeming defeat is their great victory!*

Wilcock says Ps 124 is *the testimony of believers who have found themselves not simply threatened but actually trapped (v. 7). But somehow, not by their own doing, the snare has been broken. God has done it; if 123 was a distress psalm, 124 is a power psalm. In that is our confidence. How could the God who created all things (Ps 124:8) be defeated by a bird-catcher’s snare? Still more, as the New Testament will add, how could the God who redeemed us by the gift of his Son, ‘not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?*

Olyott asks, *Is there any other God? Is there any other eternal being? Is there any other who has all power? Is there another who works all things after the counsel of his own will? No! Then nothing can prevail against God’s designs, or thwart his purposes. His purposes for us shall surely come to pass, and no suffering of the present time can possibly alter this.*
