### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What makes you sad about Jesus’s death?
2. What makes you joyful about Jesus’s death?
3. How should we respond to Jesus’s death?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.)	

What makes you sad about Jesus dying on the cross? One of the things that should make us all sad is that left to ourselves, we would reject Jesus. Had we been there, we would have shouted “crucify him!” Secondly, Jesus was wounded for our sin. It’s not just other people’s sins that put Jesus on the cross. It’s my sin. It’s your sin.

What makes you joyful about Jesus dying on the cross? Both the reason why and the effect were in God’s planned out will. Jesus bore your curse (if you savingly trust him). Jesus gave you his clean garments, his righteous robes. 

Since Jesus endured the cross for the joy set before him, as we reflect on his finished work for us, we can find joy in that work. We can delight in Jesus. We can, because we are united with him and find joy in doing God’s will—not perfectly as Jesus did, but truly and even increasingly. Look to Jesus. Run to Jesus. Follow Jesus.
