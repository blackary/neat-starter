* Jesus said anyone who has ears should listen.
* Jesus often spoke in parables.

2. What did Jesus say about planted seeds?
3. What did Jesus say about the mustard seed?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a book on listening to sermons by Christopher *Ash) Adam couldn’t really be bothered with sermons. There were a number of things he liked about church, especially the friends he had made … But not the sermons. He felt he had to put up with those because it would look a bit off if he walked out when the preacher started. They just seemed dull. Faced with the entertainment choice between \[a TV show] and The Sermon, it was a no-brainer: \[the TV show] won, any day.*

*Beth was really looking forward to the sermon. Last Sunday she had gone up to the preacher and said: “I’m so looking forward to next Sunday – can’t wait”. He looked pleased, if a bit surprised. But Beth wasn’t trying to sweet talk him; she really did look forward to the sermon, with a sense of eager anticipation. She wondered what God was going to say to her. She felt as if someone had told her to expect a telephone call from the US President: all week she was, as it were, waiting by the phone. So when the sermon started she was paying close and eager attention.*

*Beth was right . And  Adam was a fool . We are to listen to sermons expectantly …. Jesus governs His church by the written word of Scripture … it is vital that all people, without exception, hear the Bible preached.*
