### Reading

Luke 24:33-53 – Jesus in the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms.

### Notes

After these two disciples rushed back to Jerusalem, they began telling the other disciples—the eleven apostles and those with them—about what happened in their encounter with Jesus. The disciples excitedly told them that Simon (Peter) had seen Jesus alive! Then, suddenly, Jesus appeared right there with them! He calmed their fear, then he began to explain to them all about the Scriptures telling about him. 

Three specific things, Jesus told them here, were written about him in the Scriptures and must be fulfilled. The Messiah—and they had come to understand, although dimly, that Jesus was the Messiah—must suffer. They had seen this, although most of them from a distance as they had deserted him in fear. Secondly, the Messiah must rise from the dead on the third day—and they were experiencing the reality of this at that very moment! Thirdly, the Messiah must be preached! 

Bock states that *five elements dominate this mission statement. 1. The disciples will be called to preach. 2. Their message is a call to repentance. 3. What is offered is forgiveness of sins. 4. The authority for it all resides in Jesus’ name. 5. The message is for all the nations, and the preaching will start in Jerusalem*. I would add a sixth vital element—the Holy Spirit will empower Jesus’s disciples to carry out this mission. He is still doing that—may he use us!

### Questions

1. Where can we find Jesus in the Bible?
2. What does the Old Testament tell us about Jesus?
3. How did the disciples respond to Jesus’s teaching and ascension into heaven?
