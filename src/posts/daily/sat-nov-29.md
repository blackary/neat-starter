### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *Lord* and *son*.

### Reading

Mark 12:35-37 – Bow Before the King

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus quoted King David’s words about the Messiah.
* The Holy Spirit directed what David said.
* David said his descendant would be God.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Who believed that the Messiah was to be David’s son?
2. How could the Messiah be both David’s son and His Lord?
3. How should we respond to King Jesus?

### Notes

(See below for all authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on Mark by R.C. Sproul)	

*Jesus was speaking to the common people, but it is not unlikely that various Pharisees, Sadducees, and scribes were listening, too. Indeed, Jesus asked a question about the scribes’ view of the Messiah. He was asking, “Why have the intellectuals, the theologians, the rabbis of Israel concluded that the coming Messiah is to be the Son of David?”*

*But Jesus then introduced a qualification, an apparently contradictory Scripture passage. … Jesus is asking how the great David can describe one of his descendants as greater than himself. His point is that the scribes have missed something important about the Messiah. … Thus, Jesus said to the scholars: “What do you think about this? What is the Holy Spirit saying?”*

*What does this mean for us? In simple terms, it means everything. We Americans pride ourselves on living in a democracy, but as Christians we live in a kingdom, one that is actively ruled by the King of kings. His reign is ongoing. Jesus is King at this moment. He is on His throne even now. … Our King is seated on the right hand of God. He expects us, His people, to remain loyal to Him … In time, He will return and put all things right.*
