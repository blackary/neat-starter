### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *day* and *night*.

### Reading

Jeremiah 33:19-26—Daily Reminders

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Day follows night—always.
* Night follows day—always.
* As certain as day and night is God keeping his promises.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why might Jeremiah have wondered about God’s promises?
2. Why might we wonder about God’s promises?
3. How does God show his faithfulness day and night?

### Notes

How can we be sure God will grant forgiveness and grace? How can we be sure God won’t change his mind and turn away the favor He has promised? Perhaps Jeremiah was wondering that same thing. Anticipating such a question, God grants us a reminder day by day and night after night. 

If you come to the end of the day and night falls, then God is reminding you that he will not forget his covenant promises to David which are fulfilled in David’s greater Son, the Lord Jesus. If after you sleep (which is also God’s gift), you awaken to a new day dawning, then God is again reminding you of his faithful promise-keeping. 

Day after day. Night after night. God reminds us that he is always faithful and will always be faithful. As Ryken asks and then answers, *Do you ever think God has failed you? Do the troubles of life ever seem to cast doubt on God’s promises? The message of Jeremiah is that God never fails. David failed, and the sons of David may fail, but God himself never fails. Even Zedekiah would eventually learn that God never fails. Although he would be tortured, he would die in peace. The people of God would build a funeral pyre in his honor (34:4–5). For the sake of his people and for the sake of his Son, God’s promise to David did not and cannot fail.*

### Prayer

1. Rejoice in God’s daily reminder of his faithfulness.
2. Pray for the reading and preaching of God’s word tomorrow.
3. Pray for a member of our church, for your family, and for a non-Christian friend/family member.
