### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *blind* and *sinned*.

### Reading

John 9:1–12—Who Sinned? This Man or His Parents?

### Optional Reading

Job 19:1-12

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Job’s friends thought his sin caused his suffering.
* Jesus’s disciples thought that his man’s sin caused his blindness.
* God caused this man’s blindness so Jesus would heal him.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why did Job suffer?
2. Why was this man born blind?
3. What did Jesus do for this man, physically and spiritually?

### Notes

Job’s friends were certain that Job’s suffering was because he had sinned. And sometimes people do suffer directly because of their sin—either the natural consequences of their sinful actions or God’s punishment of them for their sin. But not always. As Kruse puts it, *there is a general connection between sin and suffering due to the fall. There is sometimes a direct connection between a particular sin of an individual and suffering (see 5:14), but not always (see Luke 13:2–5)*.

Here in John 9, Jesus sees a man blind from birth. And Jesus’s disciples think like Job’s friends did. Either this man or his parents must have sinned for this to happen. But Jesus says, *No, this happened to this man to display God’s works in him.* Kruse lets us know that *the ‘work of God’ is, as it nearly always is in the Fourth Gospel, the work that God does through Jesus (see 5:36; 14:10–11; 17:4)*.

So, Jesus does the work of God and heals this blind man. In fact, as we read the whole story, Jesus heals the man’s eyes and saves his soul. Our conversion story, though not likely the same physically, is very much the same spiritually, *I was blind. Now I see*.

Learn from the book of Job, and from this man born blind that suffering is not necessarily caused by personal sin.
