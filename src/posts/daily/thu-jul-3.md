1. What form of writing is this book?
2. What is this book about?
3. How is this book about Jesus?

### Notes

Today’s notes are from a commentary on the Song of Songs by Douglas Sean O’Donnell	

*Song of Songs … can be a difficult book to comprehend. The ninth-century Jewish rabbi Saadia likened the Song to “a lock for which the key had been lost.” …*

*Scholars who disagree on much of the Song all agree it’s a tough text. Thus the need for a guide to uncoil its complexities, solve its riddles, and find that lost key to unlock its door. In this first study I seek to offer some basic directions to help us navigate through the often dark (but so beautiful) waters of Solomon’s Song. By means of setting four guideposts in place, I hope to open God’s Word, as Philip did, and “beginning with this Scripture,” teach you “the good news about Jesus” (Acts 8:35), revealing to you something of the meaning of the “mystery” of marriage (Ephesians 5:32).*

*We start with the first guidepost: This is a song. … And a song (this is what I’ve learned after many years of study) is written to be sung. (Aren’t you glad I’m your guide?)*

*Perhaps this Song was originally written to be sung during the seven-day marriage festival.*

*Here’s the second guidepost: this is a song about human love set in the context of marriage. … So we know this is a wedding song from the cultural context (i.e., in Israel only sex within marriage was celebrated), but also from the language of the Song itself.*
