### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What had contributed to David’s trouble in Psalm 3?
2. Who was calling Salvation belongs to God in Revelation 7?
3. What should you remember and do in times of trouble?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

In Psalm 3, David is being attacked by many enemies. His own sin and his own son was at the heart of his attacks, as the superscription of the Psalm notes: A psalm of David when he fled from his son Absalom. We can read in 2 Samuel about David’s fathering failures that in no small part led to Absolom’s rebellion. Yet even when our distress is due to our own sin, we can call out to God in our distress. And He saves. He saves! Salvation belongs to the Lord.

David ended his Psalm of trust with those words, *Salvation belongs to the Lord*. In our reading, the innumerable gathering of saints from every nation, tribe, people, and language who were martyred faced a great tribulation (likely the siege by Rome against Jerusalem in 70AD). They called out that glorious truth as well. 

*Salvation belongs to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!* (Revelation 7:10 CSB)

Cry out to God and to the Lamb, our Lord Jesus Christ, in your distress, even if it is of your own making to a greater or lesser degree. Salvation belongs to the Lord.
