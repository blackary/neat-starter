* David had many enemies.
* Jesus had even more.
* In Jesus, we can find peace even if we have many problems.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What was the situation in which David wrote Psalm 3?
2. What did David do when faced with many enemies?
3. How can we rest on the LORD?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

David writes Psalm 3, as we find from the introductory phrase, when he fled from his son Absalom who wanted to take over his father’s kingdom. Yet it is not only his son who is against him—many are his enemies. Of course, Jesus knew this hostility of sinners against Himself as well—far more than King David, far more than us.

So, what do you do? Smith and Akin break down the Psalm into these three responses: *Share your problem with God, Shout your praise to God, and See your protection in God.*

The result of this for the Psalmist is that he can sleep, knowing that his covenant God, the LORD, is powerful and just and will sustain him. The sense of the word sleep here is that one can lean on or even lie on something or someone. Like a frightened child who rests his head against his father or mother, so we can rest on the LORD. Such resting takes faith. The child can see his father or mother, we can see God only with our eyes of faith. Yet, in His mercy, God makes those eyes of faith even more certain than what we can see with our physical eyes.

Facing troubles? Too many, perhaps, even to count. You too, in your Savior, can find Your God sustaining you so you can sleep.
