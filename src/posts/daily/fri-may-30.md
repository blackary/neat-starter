### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *know*.

### Reading

Job 19:23-29— I Know that My Redeemer Lives

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Job was having a rotten life.
* He thought some wrong things about God.
* But he knew something vitally important—my Redeemer lives!

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Have you ever had a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day? Tell about it.
2. What certainty can a Christian know—even on the worst day?
3. How did Job know he had a living Redeemer and who was it?

### Notes

The fictional Alexander, in the book by this title, had a *Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.* Job has had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad life—at least since Satan began, with God’s permission, tormenting him. And in this time Job’s friends have gotten a lot wrong and accused him falsely. Job has also gotten a lot wrong and accused God falsely.

But Job knows something. Something super important to him—and to us. So important that Job wants to write it in a book. Or even better, engrave it on a headstone in a graveyard. Except he doesn’t want weather to wear it away. IT IS IMPORTANT! Even better than being Job’s hope, his words are preserved in the Bible, God’s word!

So, what does Job know? *I know that my Redeemer lives!* In spite of all this, *I know this, my Redeemer lives and will one day make everything right.* Further, Job says, *after I die, I will see God in my flesh—that is, I will be resurrected and stand in God’s very presence.* As Ash summarizes, *what does Job “know” (v. 25)? By faith he knows three wonderful truths: he has a living Redeemer, this Redeemer will stand upon the earth, and Job will see him with his own eyes*.

Do you know this? Even if you have terrible, horrible, no good, very bad days? You can, and you should know this.
