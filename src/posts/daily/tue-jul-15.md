Listen for the word *God*.

### Reading

Ephesians 2:1-10—By Grace Alone

### Optional Reading

Isaiah 53:7-12

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* We are born dead—spiritually dead.
* Only God can make us alive.
* God gives faith to believe his saving good news.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What does it mean to be spiritually dead?
2. How can someone become spiritually alive?
3. Who does the work of salvation? Explain.

### Notes

We know that nothing we contribute to our salvation adds any good thing to us being saved—because there is nothing good in us. Jesus does it all. We are saved by grace alone. Here Paul spells out the bad news and the good news of the gospel.

And you were dead. Not the most upbeat way to begin talking to someone, is it? Bad news hurts. But good news is only good in the context of bad news. So, Paul begins with the bad news. God tells us, through Paul, that without salvation, we lived and walked as dead men and women. We were the walking dead.
Sproul notes that *Paul is not contradicting himself. His point is to describe man’s spiritual state, not his biological state.  … we are dead to the things of God, and as a result have no desire for the things of God. … with respect to spiritual things, we are dead*.

Paul introduces the good news with two words that change everything: “But God.” But God, what? But God made us alive! Hendriksen comments that *Paul ascribes the dramatic and marvelous change that has taken place, in his own life and in that of the others, to the mercy, love, and grace of God*.

Anyone who is saved is saved by grace—unmerited favor—through faith. And even that faith, Paul says, is God’s gift, not something that exists in us. So, Hendriksen notes, *the credit for the entire process of salvation must be given to God*.
