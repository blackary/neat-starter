<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What was the devil’s third temptation of Jesus?
2. How did Jesus reply? And why?
3. What might the devil promise us when he tempts us?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

The devil will not give up. Again and again he comes back. Again and again he tempts our Lord. Again and again he loses. We must remember that this is not merely teaching us how to respond to temptation. It is that, but much more. This is teaching us that Jesus defeated Satan. Had Jesus given in at the beginning of His earthly ministry He could not have saved anyone.  But He did not give in. Ever.

The devil takes Jesus to a high mountain. There, he shows Him all the glory of all the kingdoms of this world. “I’ll give them to you,” promises the devil, “if you’ll just worship me.” All for the price of one bow. What a bargain! No need for a painful death on a cross in order to be given all authority. Just a bow.

Just two minor problems. (OK, two major problems.) First, the earth is the Lord’s and all that it contains (Psalm 24:1). Satan has been given some freedom in exerting his influence in the world—for a time. But it’s all God’s. Secondly, God alone is the right object of worship. Worship Him only—as Daniel’s friends knew.

The devil left Jesus—for a time. Again and again he would tempt Jesus—in every way we are tempted (Heb. 4:15). But Jesus will never sin. So, He can sympathize with our temptation. More than that, He helps us resist temptation. Even better—He took our sin and gave us His perfection. So God is well pleased with us.
