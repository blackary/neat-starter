<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

Jesus tells us that He is one greater than Jonah. Of course, He is greater than Jonah in every way possible. But in what specific ways do we see Him greater than what we have read of Jonah so far?

He was chosen by God to go and preach—and He did. In fact, Mark records that Jesus states that He came to preach (Mk 1:38) and that is what He did—from the very beginning of His earthly ministry (Mk 1:14-15).
Instead of running from God’s assignment, Jesus determined to go to Jerusalem (Luke 10:51ff) when it was time for Him to die for our sins.

Although Jesus also slept in a boat during a great storm (Luke 8:23ff) he was not running from God. And, when He was awakened, He calmed the storm with just a word.

We know that Jesus, unlike Jonah, delighted always to do God’s will. And He always did God’s will. And God’s will included God crushing Jesus for my sin and for your sin—for the sin of all whom the Father had given Him.
