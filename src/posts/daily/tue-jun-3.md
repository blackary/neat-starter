* Except those alive when Jesus returns, we will all die.
* If we believe in Jesus we don’t have to fear death.
* We have victory over death in Jesus.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How do we know that our Redeemer lives?
2. What happens when we die?
3. How should we now live? Why?

### Notes

I read these words as my wife Nancy’s brother, Richard, breathed his last and died. In many ways I read them for us—the many family members gathered around his bed. We wanted hope in the face of death. Job had such hope. Though he was not yet on his death bed in the book of Job, he at times wished he could die. Yet he had a supernatural confidence that was two-fold. First, he knew that his Redeemer lived. Second, he knew that he would see God even after he died.

We can have even greater confidence than Job. Earlier in this chapter, Paul explains how much depends on us having a living Redeemer—one who actually was raised from the dead. And he names eyewitnesses of the risen Jesus, many of whom (Paul himself included) his readers could have gone and spoken to. Without Jesus’s resurrection, we are to be pitied more than anyone else, our gospel and our faith is worthless. 

Timothy Keller has written *if Jesus rose from the dead, then you have to accept all that he said; if he didn’t rise from the dead, then why worry about any of what he said?*

But because our Redeemer lives, we who believe in him have victory through him—victory until death, and victory over death.
