* God may at times seem far away from us.
* He’s not.
* We can call on Him to rise up and defeat His enemies.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why does it sometimes seem like God is far away?
2. What are some things to remember if we think that?
3. How do we know that Jesus is king over all?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.)	

Do you ever feel like God is far away—especially in times of trouble? David does in Psalm 10, as we saw yesterday. David notes many things about the wicked that trouble him. 

They pursue their victims relentlessly. They boast about their evil desires. They curse the Lord and praise sinners. They seem to think that God is dead or asleep. They seem to have success in all they do. They think they can get away with anything. They have wicked mouths and wicked actions. We could even say more than David says here about the wicked. But what might we do and think when we see the wicked that way?

Ask God to rise up so that His enemies are scattered. Ask God, the just judge, to judge justly. Even as we do that, though, remember and rejoice that we used to be God’s enemy, but in His grace, He saved us.

Another thing to always remember is that God is king. King of kings and Lord of lords. Jesus is on the throne now. And He will reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet (Ps 110:1, 1 Cor 15:25).
