### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

Nahum writes of God’s avenging wrath poured out on Nineveh. Sometimes people want to pit God in the Old Testament against Jesus in the New Testament. Usually that leads to a claim that God in the Old Testament is full of wrath and Jesus in the New Testament is full of love.

The truth of the matter is that God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—is full of wrath, but also full of love. In fact, God is love. Yet here in our reading, we see the wrath of God and the wrath of the Lamb being poured out. And like in Nahum, those facing the day of this wrath ask, *Who can stand?* Kistemaker notes that *the Lamb opens all the seven seals of the scroll, and it is the Lamb who unleashes his fury against his opponents. The Lamb with the scroll of world history in hand is the Judge who directs his anger against his adversaries*. None can stand against this wrath on our own merit. 

Our only hope is in the reality that Jesus is both judge and deliverer. Just one chapter earlier in Revelation, the Lamb is worshiped and praised because he purchased people for God by His blood. So, will you worship Jesus, now and eternally, because he purchased you by His blood? Or will you, in the face of His just judgment, call on the rocks hoping they can hide you? (They can’t.)
