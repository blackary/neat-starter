* We must fight against the world, our flesh, and the devil.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How does God equip David in this Psalm?
2. How does that describe Jesus?
3. How does that describe us?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on the Psalms by James Johnston)	

*David, in v. 32 begins with God’s equipping. … When a soldier goes off to boot camp, the Army begins to train him for combat, issues him equipment, and prepares him to serve in the military. Verses 33–36 describe God’s boot camp for David. God gave David speed and agility, making his “feet like the feet of a deer” (v. 33). God trained him in the use of weapons. If “a bow of bronze” (v. 34) refers to a physical bow that David used, it may have been a wooden bow with bronze decoration or a bow with bronze-tipped arrows. But this is probably a poetic way to describe the enormous strength God gave him for combat—it was as if he could bend solid bronze.7 God also provided him with armor—salvation like a “shield” (v. 35). And like the Army Corps of Engineers, God cleared a road for his feet.*

*David’s experience of God’s equipment for battle is a wonderful description of our Lord Jesus too. Jesus came as a warrior to fight spiritual battles against Satan and this fallen world. Demons could not stand before him; his enemies could not refute his wisdom; he completed his conquest by his obedience to death, even death on a cross.*

*If you are a believer, you have spiritual weapons and equipment through Jesus Christ for the battle before you. … God equips us for battle through the Lord Jesus Christ.*
