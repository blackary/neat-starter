### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What were the false prophets saying?
2. What was Jeremiah prophesying?
3. How might you seek peace/good where God has put you?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

We’ll take one more look in Jeremiah before moving on in our search for Christ in the Old Testament. Here God as already sent many of his people from Jerusalem into Babylonian captivity. But some false prophets were saying it will be okay, you will soon be brought back from Babylon, don’t serve Babylon’s king (27:14–16).

Jeremiah’s message—a message that truly was from God—was instead, accept this discipline from God. Don’t resist. Seek Babylon’s good. What?! Seek the good of this godless, pagan, nation?! Yes. Seek it’s shalom (good, peace, welfare) for in its shalom you will have shalom. And pray, because any true peace must come from God.

Where has God put you? What is there about your nation, your state, your city or neighborhood, your workplace that causes you grief, perhaps even godly grief because of the godlessness of the place(s) where you are? And what should you do about it?

Seek good. Seek shalom wherever God has put you. But seek real shalom, real peace. Don’t seek a false peace, but a peace that comes only through Jesus Christ, the Prince of peace. Live for Jesus. Proclaim Jesus. Pray that God’s kingdom might come on earth through Jesus, as his kingdom is in heaven.
