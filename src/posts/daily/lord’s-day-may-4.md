### [Swedish method](http://thebriefing.com.au/2009/01/the-swedish-method/) questions

The daily readings in this household worship guide have a few questions. However, we encourage you, as appropriate for your family, to ask the following general questions of the readings and text each day as well as of the sermon(s) and the whole service(s) each Lord’s Day.

<p><img src="/static/img/family_worship_study_ed-copy_page_1.png" width="33" height = "33"> Is there something that ‘shines’ from the text(s)—whatever impacts most, or draws attention?</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/family_worship_study_ed-copy_page_2.png" width="33" height = "33"> Is there something you don’t understand, or a question the text(s) raises in your mind?</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/family_worship_study_ed-copy_page_3.png" width="33" height = "33"> Is there a personal application to your life?</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/family_worship_study_ed-copy_page_4.png" width="33" height = "33"> Is there something you plan to share with someone else–and who will you share it with?</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/family_worship_study_ed-copy_page_5.png" width="33" height = "33"> How do ideas in the text(s) interrelate? Or with other passages in this book–or in the whole Bible?</p>
