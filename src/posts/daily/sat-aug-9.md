### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *blessed*.

### Reading

Matthew 5:3–10—Hunger and Thirst

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* The sixth act in communion is eating and drinking.
* In the Lord’s supper we eat and drink of Jesus spiritually.
* This helps us be better fit to serve the Lord.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What are the six significant acts in communion?
2. What do we eat and drink in communion?
3. Why do we need to eat and drink, spiritually, of Jesus? 

### Notes

Today’s notes are taken from the Young People's manual of RPCNA to help us prepare for the Lord’s Supper

*Remember, we are considering the six significant acts to be understood as we come to the table of the Lord. The first act was that Jesus took bread. The second significant act was that he blessed the bread. The third act was that Jesus broke the bread. The fourth significant act is the giving of the elements to the communicants. The fifth act, the first on the part of the communicants, is that of taking the elements.* 

*The second act on the part of the communicant, and the sixth and last in the series as a whole, is the eating and drinking, in obedience to the command, "Take, eat; take, drink."  Physically we eat in order that the body may have something to assimilate, something to live on, something to do work with. Also, eating and drinking imply that we are hungry and thirsty.  Hunger and thirst, therefore, are good things.  They show that our system is in good condition, that it is ready and eager to take in what it needs, in order to keep it healthy and hardy and fit for service.*
