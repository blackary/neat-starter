### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What does Jesus promise here in Acts 1 that those who receive the Spirit will do?
2. What are some other ways the Spirit works in us?
3. Why do we need the Holy Spirit?

### Notes

Ezra notes that all those whose spirit God had stirred went from Babylon to Jerusalem, at Cyrus’s decree, to build God’s house. Here in our reading today, Jesus promises to send the Holy Spirit upon his disciples. In John 14:26 Jesus tells his disciples that the Father sends the Holy Spirit in Jesus’s name. 

From this text and others, we see that we are given the Holy Spirit to stir our spirit in various ways. Here in Acts 1, those who are stirred by the promised Holy Spirit will be Jesus’ witnesses. Keddie notes that *Christ’s followers would be equipped for the task, for they would ‘receive power’ when the Holy Spirit came upon them (1:8). The implication, later to be confirmed in the experience of the church, is that, once come, the Holy Spirit would always remain to empower the true church while the world lasts. The church would never be left to act in her own strength, but would be enabled to follow the clear leading and working of the Spirit*.

And there is more stirring work from the Holy Spirit to the spirit of God’s people. In Acts 4 they are given boldness in the face of persecution. In 1 Corinthians 12 they are given a place in the body of Christ, his church. In Romans 8 they are given freedom from sin and death and convinced in their spirits by Jesus’s Spirit that they are God’s children. In 1 John 4 they confess that Jesus has come in the flesh. And much more!
