### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What did Bartimaeus want Jesus to do for him?
2. What (or who) healed Bartimaeus?
3. Who heals us?

### Notes

<div><small><i>Mon-Wed notes this week were written by Tyler H. in preparation for reviewing our visiting preacher.</i></small></div>

Similarly to the woman in Mark 7, Bartimaeus also knew who Jesus was. Since he knew who Jesus was, he cried out to Him for help: “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” Hughes notes that Bartimaeus displayed a penetrating insight into the person of Christ. His use of the title Son of David showed that he had some sense of who Jesus is, even if he didn’t understand the full implications of it.

Because Bartimaeus understood who Jesus is, he didn’t allow the crowds to silence him. Amazingly, he continued to cry out all the more to Jesus! If Jesus really is the Messiah and Savior of the world, where else could he—or we—go for help?

Jesus took notice of Bartimaeus’ cries and called him over. Christ stands in stark contrast to the crowds and showed compassion towards this man in his suffering. He is gentle and lowly in heart and will never cast out one who comes to Him. In the conversation that follows, Jesus asks the man what he wants Him to do for him. This question is meant to strengthen Bartimaeus’ faith so he could bring his request to Jesus.

So, he answers Jesus, “Let me recover my sight.” Jesus saw His faith and vindicated it, telling him that his faith made him well. He was healed, that is, saved. Though his faith in Christ healed his eyes, that was evidence that it also saved his soul. This is shown in that he followed Jesus on that way.
