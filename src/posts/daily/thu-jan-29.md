* “Scriptures” in the NT almost always refers to the OT.
* Jesus met two disciples on His resurrection day.
* He explained to them the OT scriptures about Himself.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Where can we find Jesus in the Bible?
2. What does the Old Testament tell us about Jesus?
3. How did the disciples respond to Jesus’s teaching and ascension into heaven?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

For the New Testament writers, with only one possible exception, the Scriptures means to them what we call the Old Testament. Over the last several months, we have been considering Christ in the Old Testament. Each week we considered a chapter from a book in the Old Testament, looking for Christ in every OT book. Why did we do that? Because, as we read in v. 27, Jesus tells us that the Scriptures all speak of him.

Having finished in Malachi, we will now return to Luke 24 in review. On his resurrection day, Jesus appeared to two disciples, Cleopas and another unnamed disciple, as they walked from Jerusalem to Emmaus. These two were, as were many of Jesus’s disciples, downcast and confused. “We thought he was the king,” they told him. “Now he’s dead. But there are some rumors that he’s alive. What in the world is going on?!”

For most of the encounter, these two disciples didn’t recognize Jesus. As they explained their sorrow and confusion, Jesus rebuked them and then explained to them the Scriptures about himself. Hughes suggests that *If there is anything that would make a preacher swell with envy, this is it! This was exegetical Heaven! The root idea of “explained” is the word from which we derive the word hermeneutics, the science of Bible interpretation. The Word of God incarnate explained the written Word of God.* 

Might we swell with love for our Savior as we search for him in all the Scriptures!
