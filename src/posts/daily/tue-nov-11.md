* The Pharisees wanted a sign from Jesus.
* Jesus offered the sign of Jonah—3 days “buried.”
* Jesus is greater than Jonah.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How is Jesus greater than Jonah?
2. What is required besides realizing that Jesus is greater?
3. What sign did Jesus give to all generations?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

As we noted yesterday, Jesus tells us that he is One greater than Jonah. In comparison to the reluctant evangelist in Jonah 1, Jesus is greater in every way. However, realizing and admitting that isn’t enough. The critical question is: “Are you trusting the One greater than Jonah?”

The religious leaders of Jesus’s day were neither admitting that Jesus was greater than Jonah, nor were they trusting Him. Instead, they were demanding a sign. As O’Donnell puts it, *they were demanding, GIVE ME A SIGN, and then I’ll believe. Give me some sign that Jesus is the Son of God, and then I will gladly become a Christian. I’ll go to church, say my prayers, read my Bible, and do the other things Christians are supposed to do. Just give me a sign.*

However, the only sign that Jesus says will be given to every generation is His death and resurrection. O’Donnell helps with this statement: *In Jesus’ life and ministry, God has delivered one proof after another, but in Jesus’ death and resurrection he has pulled out all the stops, giving us all that is necessary to believe. The resurrection of the crucified Christ—that is the sign. Period. Exclamation point. One sign. Take it or leave it. … Behold the Lamb of God slain and yet he lives! Behold the sign of Jonah!*

So, again, “Are you trusting the One greater than Jonah?”
