### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What does it mean to be dead in this passage?
2. What does it mean to be in Christ?
3. What are some of the "immeasurable riches" we have in Christ?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

When God created Adam, He told Him not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. “For in the day that you eat of it,” God said, “you shall surely die.” But Adam disobeyed and ate, and on that day he did die. He didn’t drop dead at that moment, but his eyes were opened to his sin. He was dead in trespasses and sins. And ever since then, every person has been born in his likeness and after his image. “Behold, I was brought forth in iniq-uity, and in sin did my mother conceive me” (Ps. 51:5).

But when the fullness of time came, God sent forth His Son, born of woman, born under the law—the second Adam (cf. Gal. 4:4; Rom. 5:18–21). Our Lord Jesus Christ was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification! He is seated at the right hand of God, and our lives have been hidden with Christ. And when Christ, who is our life, appears, we will also appear with Him in glory (Col. 3:1–4). This is indeed a great salvation!
