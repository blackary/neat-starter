### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *us* and *my*.

### Reading

Lamentations 3:1-18—The Lord is Against Me!

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* God turned against Jerusalem for their sin.
* God turned against Jesus for our sin.
* We can be saved because God judged Jesus for our sin.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why was Judah facing this trouble?
2. What is some of the evidence God was against them?
3. Why might we face trouble?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

Even more difficult that knowing that their enemies were against them, for Jeremiah (and for Christ on the cross), was the hard reality that God Himself was against them. Listen to the evidence Jeremiah piles up.

* V1 God afflicted me by rod of His wrath
* V2 He made me walk in darkness
* V3 He turned His hand against me
* V4 He aged me
* V5 He surrounded me with woe
* V7 He has weighed me down with heavy chains
* V8 He ignores my prayer
* V9 He makes me walk in hard paths
* V11 He has torn me to pieces like a wild animal would
* V15 He filled me with bitterness, made me drink poison
* V16 He broke my teeth, causing me to eat gravel
* V17 He has taken peace from my soul
* V18 He caused my strength and hope to perish

For the people of Judah, this was due to their sin. For Christ, this was due to our sin. God was bringing judgment. We may face difficulties for our sin, or we may face them because God is working in us for His own glory.
