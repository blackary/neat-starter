* We bless the Lord for saving us.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What were the first two significant acts?
2. Why did Jesus bless the bread?
3. Why did we need a substitute to die for us?

### Notes

Today’s notes are taken from the Young People's manual of RPCNA to help us prepare for the Lord’s Supper.	

*We are considering the six significant acts to be understood as we come to the table of the Lord. The first act was that Jesus took bread.* 

*When he had taken the bread he blessed it.  This was his second significant act.  He blessed it while he was giving thanks (Mark 14:22: Luke 22:19).  The act signifies that he was himself blessed of God, when, at his baptism on the banks of the Jordan, the Father publicly approved of him, and set him apart to the infinite task of redeeming men, by saying from the cloud, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (Matthew. 3:17).*

*Then and there, within the hearing of men, the Lord Jesus was formally and officially recognized as the promised Messiah, and as the one and only substitute who could answer for sinners acceptably to God.  Also, on his own part, Christ then and there consecrated himself publicly to the work of redemption, and engaged, by a definite historical act, to take our place before the throne of infinite justice and die in our stead.  When he blessed the bread, therefore, he set it apart to signify that, at his baptism, he had dedicated his life, by a formal act, to the salvation of men.  Thus the act is significant, in that it displays, as it were before the eyes, the doctrine of Substitution.*
