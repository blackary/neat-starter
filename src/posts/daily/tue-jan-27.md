### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What does it mean to be made a new creation?
2. What kinds of good works do you think God has prepared for you to do?
3. How can you start doing those good works today?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	 

In Isaiah, our righteous deeds done in the flesh are like a “polluted garment” (Isa. 64:6). No one will be justified before God by their works, because they are imperfect. But in Ephesians, Paul tells us that we are made (or remade) as God’s workmanship so that we can do good works for Him! But we can’t get the order mixed up: God remakes us and saves us first (Eph. 2:1–10a) and then we do good works for Him (Eph. 2:10b).

Paul also tells us that God prepared the good works for us beforehand! Not only is God the one who sovereignly saves, but He is also the one who appoints good deeds for us to do. We are truly dependent on God from beginning to end! As you think about this, ask yourself what good works God may have prepared for you. It might not be as tricky to answer as you think. God has given you a vocation. Whether it’s as a brother or sister, a student, a spouse, a parent, or an employee, God desires us to do the ordinary things in life to His glory. *So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God* (1 Corinthians 10:31).
