### Notes

Today’s notes are from a commentary on James by Daniel Doriani

*It is elementary wisdom that anger does not lead to righteousness. There is such a thing as righteous indignation, but our anger is rarely righteous. On the one hand, we often become indignant about trivial things: a pokey driver making us late for an appointment; a string of poorly synchronized traffic lights, wasting our time; an unskilled referee wounding our favorite team with a bad call. Such things stir our wrath. On the other hand, we ignore true injustice, especially if it occurs far away and falls upon strangers. Sadly, our anger is often burdened with “self-importance, self assertion, intolerance, and stubbornness.”*

*Such anger makes it difficult to get along with other people. It also makes it difficult to go along with God, for anger makes us slow to listen and receive his word. Therefore, James says, “Get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you” …*

*Ultimately, James says, the word of God must do this work. Through the word, God gives birth to his children (1:18). It discloses our true condition. It describes our need of God’s mercy and directs us to that mercy. It says no one can simply “put off all … wickedness.” The word of God, implanted in the heart, can change a heart.*
