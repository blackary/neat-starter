### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the names *Adam* and *Noah*.

### Reading

1 Chronicles 1:1-4—Adam, Seth, Enosh…

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* This chapter begins with 10 names—Adam to Noah.
* We know more about Noah, Methuselah, Enoch, and Adam.
* In his grace, Adam undid what Adam did in his sin.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What did Adam do that affected all of us?
2. How could the oldest man to live die before his father?
3. What did Jesus do that affected all who believe in him?

### Notes

This book, which has 9 chapters of names, begins with these 10 names: Adam, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah. We know something of each of these names, though little about a few of them. Noah, of course, built the ark in which the land and air animals along with Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives were saved during the flood. 

Methuselah, the oldest man who ever lived, died before his father did. That riddle is solved remembering that Enoch, his father, did not die, but was taken directly to heaven after walking with God for his 365 years on this earth.

Yet, it is the first name, Adam, who is the father of us all. Though sceptics scoff and scoffers scorn, and sadly, even Christians waver, we are called all throughout the Bible to believe that Adam was indeed the first created human being in this world that God made. 

So we read: *Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death spread to all people, because all sinned.* Rom 5:12 (CSB)

But thanks be to God, we also read: *If by the one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ*. Rom 5:17 (CSB)

You have Adam’s sin. Do you have Christ’s righteousness?
