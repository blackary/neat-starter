### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *Jesus* and *crucified*.

### Reading

Matthew 27:24-37—Where’s the Joy in This?

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus suffered greatly on the cross.
* First, he was deserted, arrested, mocked, and beaten.
* Jesus willingly went to the cross for the joy set before him.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why did Pilate give up Jesus to be crucified?
2. What did the soldiers do to Jesus before he was crucified?
3. What was the written charge against Jesus?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on Matthew by John Legg.)	

*This account of the trial of Jesus confirms that he is the innocent substitute for sinners, the suffering Messiah, the Saviour of his people. Nothing remains for him but to die a cursed death. We can only feebly imagine what he went through during this period of time. He has endured a long and wearisome day. He has been betrayed and deserted, arrested and spat upon, struck with fists and slapped in the face, insulted and degraded. He has been flogged to within inches of death and then mocked and derided by the soldiers. The mental agony combined with the physical pain, however, is only the prelude to his deepest suffering. All this, we are told, is borne because of the sins of others, for he is innocent. He is going to die in the place of others, who deserve mercy as little as Barabbas did. …*

*It was customary for the condemned man to carry his cross, or at least the crossbeam, to the place of crucifixion. This must have been beyond the strength of our Lord after his flogging…*

*Just as those responsible for his crucifixion would not let the ground of his condemnation be forgotten, so Matthew wants us to remember that this is our King who is being crucified, not the traditional King of the Jews, but God’s Messianic King of his people.*
