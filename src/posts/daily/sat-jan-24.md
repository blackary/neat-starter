### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *Lord* and *Israel*.

### Reading

Amos 9:1-15—Judgment and Restoration

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Israel was God’s special nation.
* Yet too often they lived very sinful lives.
* God destroyed Israel but saved a remnant.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What did God see when He looked at Israel?
2. What does God see when He looks at you?
3. How is God continually restoring His church?

### Notes

(See below for all authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on Amos by Gordon Keddie)	

*The key expression in these verses is ‘the sinful kingdom’ (9:8). This describes the real state of the nation. In their own eyes, however, the Israelites were not that bad at all. It must have been a terrible shock for them to hear that God now regarded them as no different from other nations, the ‘lesser breeds without the law’, to use Kipling’s phrase.‘  …*

*Men want to feel that God is on their side and that he accepts them ‘warts and all’. But God looks at Israel and sees ‘the sinful kingdom’. … The Lord has stripped away the pretensions of Israel. … \[Yet] There will be a remnant according to the election of grace. …*

*In the long run, the Lord’s people will be reconstituted as a revived and faithful church of God. And the proof of this is in all that was revealed in Jesus Christ, in all that the gospel has acccomplished in millions of lives through the ministry of the New Testament church and even, if we may be so bold, in the fact that you, reader of this book, have the gospel preached to you at this moment in your experience. God … spoke a word of free grace to the remnant, even in the midst of the maelstrom of judgement!*
