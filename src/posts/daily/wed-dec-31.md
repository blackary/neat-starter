### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What are ways to prepare to come to the Lord’s Supper?
2. What are reasons one might doubt being in Christ?
3. How does God affirm if you are in Christ?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. For the next few months in preparation for communion we will read through a modern English revision of the Westminster Larger Catechism on the Lord’s Supper)	

*Q171. How are those who receive the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper to prepare themselves before they come to it?*

*A.	 Those who receive the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper are to prepare themselves before they come by examining themselves in regard to their being in Christ, their sins and needs, the truth and extent of their knowledge, faith, repentance, love to God and the brethren, kindness to all people, forgiveness of those who have done them wrong, their desires after Christ, and their new obedience; and they are to renew the exercise of these graces by serious meditation, and fervent prayer.*

*Q172. May someone who doubts of his being in Christ, or of his proper preparation, come to the Lord’s Supper?*

*A.	 Someone who doubts of his being in Christ or of his proper preparation for the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper may have a true share in Christ although he is not yet assured of it. In God’s reckoning he has this share if he is duly affected by his perception of his need of it, and sincerely desires to be found in Christ, and to depart from wickedness. Since promises are made to even weak and doubting Christians, and this sacrament is also appointed for their assistance, such a one is to lament his unbelief and seek earnestly to have his doubts resolved. If he has this attitude he may and ought to come to the Lord’s Supper in order that he may be strengthened further.*
