1. How did God free His people from Egypt?
2. In what ways did the waters flee?
3. How does God use His power?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are taken from a commentary on the Psalms by Daniel L. Akin, Johnny M. Hunt, and Tony Merida)	

*This psalm celebrates the grace of God. God’s people enjoy a special relationship with him. This God, who governs all of nature, has blessed his people. This God, who has mountains quaking before them, has redeemed his people.*

*The psalmist reflects on God’s redeeming work by mentioning the exodus from Egypt, the covenant at Sinai, the crossing of the Jordan River, and God’s provision for his people in the wilderness. The writer uses exuberant personification to highlight these events, events that should encourage God’s people regardless of their present conditions. Spurgeon says, “True poetry here has reached its climax: no human mind has ever been able to equal, much less to excel, the grandeur of this Psalm” (Treasury, vol. 3, 41). The reason for the dramatic language is simple. The psalmist wants to draw attention to the Lord’s awesome power.*

*Indeed, the Passover celebration reminded God’s people of the Redeemer’s power. They were to stand amazed by it and rejoice in it. They were never to forget God’s freeing them from Egypt.*

*We too should mark particular moments in our lives when we experience God’s power and grace. When we consider God’s intervention in our lives, it can lift us from present despair. It can give us God-centered hope now.*
