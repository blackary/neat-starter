### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on Mark by Steve Wilmshurst)	*This passage holds a very serious warning for anyone who is rejecting Christ’s message. Tacked on to the end of Jesus’ explanation of the parable of the sower is the cryptic little saying about the lamp (4:21–23). This mini-parable has been interpreted in various ways, but in this context the lamp which ‘comes’ (the literal meaning of ‘bring in’ or ‘brought in’ in 4:21) surely represents Jesus himself and his mission. The message may be hidden to begin with—hidden away in parables, hard to understand. But in the end, truth will out. One day, everyone on earth will be confronted with the truth shining out.* 

*As Jesus spoke these words, very few people—a few dozen perhaps—had any real idea of who he was, and even they didn’t have the full picture. But, as the years have passed, the truth of Jesus Christ has spread throughout the world, and now hundreds of millions have seen his light. One day there will be no concealment, as everyone on earth will be forced to see it. But when that day comes, it will be too late for those who have spent their lives rejecting Christ. God will hold each of us accountable for the response we give to his Son. Jesus says, ‘If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear’ (4:23). He tells us, ‘Consider carefully what you hear’ (4:24).*
