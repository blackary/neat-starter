### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How do we know Isaiah is writing about Jesus?
2. Why was Jesus punished for the sins of others?
3. What is so amazing about God’s saving grace?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	 

Isaiah 53 is one of the easiest Old Testament passages to find Jesus. Even Jews sometimes mistake Isaiah 53 for New Testament writings. However, what is so familiar to us is not always clear to everyone. The Ethiopian eunuch of Acts 8 needed Philip to explain Isaiah 53 to him, after which he came to faith and repentance. 

Here this suffering servant is punished as a substitute for us. That is amazing. Amazing Grace. Make no mistake, just as we can easily see Jesus in this Old Testament prophecy, we can also easily see us. Ortland states that *Isaiah writes as if we were there at the cross, because we were. If it wasn’t our guilt that required the death of Jesus, what did? … Isaiah is … not only describing Jesus; he’s telling our story too. We cannot say, “If I had been there, I wouldn’t have shouted ‘Crucify him!’”*

As unfair as it might seem on the surface for Jesus to be punished for my sin, for your sin, that is the only way that we can be saved. Because the Lord punished Jesus for my sin, I don’t have to face the eternal punishment that my sin against the only true God deserves. Despite Jesus willingly making this wonderful, sacrificial, substitute, too often we don’t value him. 

Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. Trust in Christ’s love and work to give you the hope of salvation that Paul had, and to give you confidence to serve Christ as Paul did.
