### Questions

3. What are the two responses to Jesus’s kingship?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

Obadiah prophecies of a savior to come who will be king. The New Testament makes clear that Jesus is that promised king. From his birth (Mt. 2:2), to his ministry (Mk. 1:14-15), to his crucifixion (Lk. 23:38), to his ascension (Ep. 1:20–23) he is announced as king. Here in our text we are told that *the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever* (v. 15b). We need not think that Jesus’s kingship will come someday. In fact, as Gentry notes, *contrary to popular opinion today, Jesus discourages us from awaiting his kingdom as if he were going to establish it at his glorious, visible Second Coming*. 

Jesus’s kingship has come, and his kingdom is coming, as he taught us to pray. He is the long-awaited King now. All authority has been given to him (Mt. 28:18). He is King of kings (Rev. 17:14). He will reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet (1 Cor. 15:25). 

As King, he will come in judgment and in mercy. All who confess him as Savior and Lord receive God’s free gift of eternal life. All who reject him as King receive the due wages of their sin—eternal death. Revere Jesus as King. Love him. Trust him. Worship him.
