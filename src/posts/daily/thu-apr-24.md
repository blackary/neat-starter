### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How many days have you had to learn the fear of the Lord?
2. Why should households gather to worship God?
3. How do we learn about how to worship God?

### Notes

Fathers have over 6,500 opportunities, if taking once each day, to call their children, in their first 18 years, to *come, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord* (Psalm 34:11). Family or household worship is an ideal way for fathers to make this call. Family or household worship is an ideal way for any household to listen to God and learn better the fear of the Lord.

Household worship is, as the name suggests, members of the household gathering to worship God together. It includes instruction from the head of the household to those gathered so that they might know and follow the Lord. Of course, worship is more than instruction. However, we are to worship what we know and Who we know, so instruction from God in his word is a vital part of worship—private, household, and corporate.

In our text today, the Psalmist reminds God’s people that God “established a testimony in Jacob and set up a law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach to their children” (v.5). The reason for this command was so that the children, even those not yet born, would *put their confidence in God and not forget God’s works, but keep his commands* (Ps 78:7). This was in order that the generations to come would *not be like their ancestors, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not loyal and whose spirit was not faithful to God* (Ps 78:8). So, a family meeting to worship God is a vital practice, in order that they, and their offspring, will follow after God.
