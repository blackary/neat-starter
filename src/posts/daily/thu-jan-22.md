* Every single person is born spiritually dead.
* Because we were born dead, we love to sin.
* God is angry because of our sin.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Do you think you're a good person?
2. What three things used to rule over us? (see the notes)
3. What does God think of sin?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

Do you think you're a good person? Many people would probably answer "yes" to this question. However, in this passage, Paul would disagree.

We are dead in our trespasses and sins. This doesn’t mean that our bodies are dead (although sin eventually results in this!), but that we are dead spiritually. And because we are dead, we love to sin.

Not only are we dead, but we’re also enslaved. Paul says that we were enslaved to three things: the world, the devil, and the flesh. You don’t need to look far to see how each of these things influence and fight against you even now!

On account of all of these things, God is angry. This is an unpopular thing to say, but God hates sin, and He is ready to punish every sin. So let me ask again, do you think you’re a good person? Do you love your sin? May God help us all learn to hate our sin and repent of it!
