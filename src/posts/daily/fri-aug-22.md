### Reading

Lamentations 3:19-24 His Mercies Never End!

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jeremiah was discouraged.
* Yet he remembered God’s steadfast love and found hope.
* He also found hope in remembering God’s eternal mercies.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What does Jeremiah remember about God’s mercies?
2. What does Jeremiah remember about God’s compassions?
3. What happens when he doesn’t remember these things?

### Notes

(See last page for authors)	

We’ll not consider all the details of this long acrostic lament in chapter 3, but we do see clear details emerge. Jeremiah mourns with Jerusalem, because “all our enemies are against us.” v46

This, of course, was the historical reality which Jeremiah witnessed. See 2 Ki 25. Fee and Stuart note that *the siege lasted for two years, as tens of thousands huddled in Jerusalem, hoping that Yahweh would intervene. Instead, the Babylonian troops finally breached her walls, raped her women, and slaughtered many of her inhabitants. In light of subsequent conditions in Jerusalem, our author wonders rhetorically whether death might not have been the better option*.

There was a severe famine promised to God’s disobedient in Deut 28 in which they would eat their own children. These “promised people” living in their “promised land” were being removed and their land was being destroyed.

The lamenter is certain that these enemies deserved worse judgment than God’s people! His hope, Judah’s hope, is that God would eventually judge them too. V64-66
