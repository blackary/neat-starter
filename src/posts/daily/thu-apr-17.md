### Questions

1. Who is Jesus Christ?
2. How did Jesus show His humility?
3. Why did Christ die?

### Notes

Jesus Christ is God. As the writer to the Hebrews puts it, the Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of his nature. Yet Jesus was willing to set this glory aside, for a time, to serve His people by becoming their Savior. How did He do that?

He was born in this world. God the Son went through the birthing process and was given an animal’s food trough for a bed. Humility and service are hard for us. We often think, I’m too good for that. We’re not, really. Jesus was. Really! 

After His birth, he lived his one-third-of-a-century-long life in this sin-filled world. He got tired. He got hungry. He got hurt. God did this. God the Son—very God of very God. He lived most of His life in this world in obscurity. But He lived a perfect life in this imperfect world.

His life was hard. And then, He died. He died for me! O, Christian, He died for you. Sometimes heroes die on behalf of someone else they think is worthy of their sacrifice. The story of such sacrifice often moves us to tears. But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

And because Christ died for us, we are able to live for Him. We are enabled to, and commanded to, have His mind, His attitude. We can serve because He came to serve and to give His life as a ransom for us.
