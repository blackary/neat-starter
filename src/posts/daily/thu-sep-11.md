### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *image* (or *statue*).

### Reading

Daniel 3:1-7—The Edict: Worship This Image or Die

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* King Nebuchadnezzar built a 90-foot-tall false god.
* He called on all the people to worship it.
* When the instruments played, they were to worship it.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Who were called to the statue dedication?
2. What instruments were played to call people to worship the gold statue?
3. What should God’s people do if something like this happens?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

The book of Daniel is a series of court stories focusing especially on Daniel and his friends rising to prominence in Babylon because of their godly character and God’s constant deliverance. As we read Daniel 3, we find again, as Duncan states, *a story in which first, the people of God are faced with a crisis because of their faith. Then, having prayerfully and carefully followed the commands of the Lord, the people of God are delivered by the Lord and then the people of God are honored even by the civil rulers*.

Let’s not be lulled by this repetition. Satan continues to work. God’s people continue to be under attack—certainly by the evil one and often throughout history by evil people. Here King Nebuchadnezzar builds a 90-foot-tall statue and commands everyone to worship it. And this is not a suggestion—it is a royal edict with the death penalty for disobeying. 

Did you notice the repetition in these verses? First all the people who are called to the dedication of this statue are repeated—*the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces* (v.2, v. 3). Then the musical instruments that were played to call everyone to worship this statue were repeated—*the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music* (v. 5, v. 7). And when the music played, everyone bowed down to worship. Everyone? We’ll find out tomorrow.
