* David cut off Goliath’s head with Goliath’s sword.
* Nobody can live without a head.
* Israel defeated the Philistines after David killed Goliath.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How did David kill Goliath?
2. What did David do with Goliath’s head?
3. What do we know for sure about a body without a head?

### Notes

David defeated Goliath with a sling and a stone. He killed him without having a sword. But having killed him, he took the giant’s own sword and cut off his head. Keddie comments that *Goliath had gone the way of his god, Dagon, when he fell before the ark of the covenant—even to the loss of his head (1 Sam 5:4)! The Philistines’ hero was as dead as their so-called god! And they knew there was a God in Israel!*

And knowing that, the change in both the Philistine army and the army of Israel was dramatic. The army of Israel, that had quaked in fear of Goliath, rose with a shout and plundered the Philistine army that ran in terror before them.

Goliath’s head keeps being central to the story, though. We’re told that David took it to Jerusalem. Those who study the Bible differ on what is going on here. Is this a historical note looking forward to when King David would conquer Jerusalem in 2 Samuel 5? Or did David meet Saul in the lower city of Jerusalem that was partially captured (Judges 18,21)? We just don’t know for sure. But David has Goliath’s head with him—a certain sign of his victory!
