### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *joy* and *rejoice*. 

### Reading

1 Peter 1:6-12—Joy in Distress

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* We can have joy even when we are in distress.
* God cares for us when we are in distress.
* We can tell God about our sorrows.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How can we believe in Jesus whom we have not seen?
2. What does our loving belief in God produce?
3. How did the prophets and the angels regard salvation?

### Notes

(See below for all authors. )	

Peter was an eyewitness of Jesus. However, these scattered Christians were not—and we are not. Yet one day we will see Him. But we love Him now because we believe in Him now. That loving belief gives us great joy. Kistemaker notes that *already in this present life believers experience indescribable joy; they do not have to wait until they leave this earthly scene. Even now they are filled with joy that is “inexpressible and glorious.*” 

That joy is not dependent on our life situation. Even in our distress we can have joy knowing that God cares about our distress, and our distress is only *for a little while* (v.6). In contrast, God-given, genuine faith results in *praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ* (v7). So our salvation is already, but also yet to come.

This salvation that is coming to us has been long anticipated. The prophets of the Old Testament searched carefully to understand the significance of the salvation they wrote about. So, we have to remember that we have heard and now preach a whole-Bible salvation. Such great salvation, planned from eternity, causes even the angels to rejoice. Are they seeing this salvation joy in you and in our church?

Psalm 73c, 57b

### Prayer

1. Ask God to give you a saving, growing, joyful faith.
2. Pray for the reading and preaching of God’s word tomorrow.
3. Pray for a member of our church, for your family, and for a non-Christian friend/family member.
