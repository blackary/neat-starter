### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What is the central message of the whole Bible?
2. What does the Old Testament tell us about the resurrection?
3. What have you found in the Old Testament about Jesus?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.)

In the resurrection, that glorious defeat of sin and death and the Evil One, Jesus fulfilled the promised Old Testament Scriptures. So, we should expect to see Jesus in the Scriptures. 

Sidney Greidanus, in *Preaching Christ from the Old Testament*, calls us to *truly understand the message of the \[Old Testament] text as it fits in with the climax of God’s revelation in the person, work, and teaching of Jesus Christ so that we and other people may believe Him, trust Him, love Him, and obey Him*.

Graeme Goldsworthy, in *Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture*, reminds us that *Jesus says that the Old Testament is a book about him. … Luke records for us the extraordinary claim of the risen Christ that he is the subject of all the Scriptures (Luke 24:27, 44-45). … the \[Bible] … finds its coherence only in …Christ*.

David Murray, in *Jesus on Every Page*, states *we must be willing to put in the hours, the sweat, the toil, and the tears as we break up the long-untilled ground of the Old Testament. Above all, despite the prevalence of Christ-less moralism and the pressures of Christless academia, we must strive to find and enjoy Jesus in the OT.*

Have you found our OT study profitable and enjoyable?
