* And promises that we belong to God through Jesus

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Will God ever break his covenant(s)? How do you know?
2. What are the promises of this new covenant?
3. How can you and I keep covenant with God?

### Notes

In Judges 2, God says, I will never break my covenant with you. Here in Hebrews, God says, *Jesus is the mediator of a better covenant; one established on better promises*. This new covenant is not a result of God breaking his covenant, but of his fulfilling it in Jesus.

Kistemaker explains it like this: *Throughout Scripture God’s recurring message to his people is the promise: “I will be their God, and they will be my people” (see, for example, Exod. 6:7; Lev. 26:12; Jer. 7:23; 11:4; 2 Cor. 6:16; Rev. 21:3). In New Testament times, too, God addresses the believers in Jesus Christ and gives them the covenant promise: “I will be \[your] God, and \[you] will be my people.” In this new covenant, God is inseparably united with his people because God’s law has been inscribed on their hearts. … Filled with the knowledge of the Lord, even novices in the faith are able and equipped to witness for him. All those who have the law of God in their hearts and minds acknowledge God’s grace and mercy. They know that their sins have been forgiven and that their record has been wiped clean. … This new covenant established through the death of Jesus on the cross is the believer’s guarantee that his sins are forgiven and forgotten.*

Thanks be to God that he never has and never will break his covenant. May we, united to Jesus, keep covenant with God.
