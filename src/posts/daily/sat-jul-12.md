<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Who was responsible for Jesus’s death? Explain.
2. What was the result of Jesus’s death?
3. Who should have died for their sin?

### Notes

God the Father was willing to crush God the Son. Many Bible translations actually read that the Lord will be pleased to crush this servant. Butler translates v10 this way: B*ut Yahweh delighted in his crushing; he made him sick. If his soul would set up a guilt offering, he will see seed; he will prolong days, and the delight of Yahweh will prosper in his hand.*

It’s hard to understand Christ willingly going to the cross. It’s also hard to understand the Father willingly sending him to the cross. If that were the end of the story it would be impossible to understand. Yet the Father was also willing to prosper his servant. Death was not victorious over him. And the clear result of his death and resurrection was that many are counted righteous—declared righteous with a righteousness that is by faith, not by works. 

This victory is won entirely by the suffering servant. Yet the victory is shared with all who put their trust in him. Smith notes that t*he Servant would be regarded as a great conqueror, one who shares the spoils of victory with his followers. Victory, however, would come only through the fact that the Servant was willing to suffer as a sin-bearer and pour out himself in death. Through his death and resurrection he made intercession*.
