### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What is concurrence?
2. What is providence?
3. How did God work good out of Joseph’s brothers’ evil acts?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are taken from a devotional on Romans by R.C. Sproul)	

*The fact that evil is redeemed for good is based on what theologians call, under the heading of providence, the doctrine of concurrence or confluence. The doctrine of concurrence holds that certain actions in which humans exercise their will to do what they wish, even to making diabolical choices, are nevertheless under the providence of God, who is at work in them. He has the power to trump our evil inclinations and desires and bring good to pass.*

*The best illustration in the Bible of the doctrine of concurrence occurs at the end of the book of Genesis. Joseph suffered greatly at the hands of his treacherous and envious brothers. He was separated from his family and countrymen, sold into slavery, falsely accused, and thrown into prison. Finally, through the providence of God, Joseph was rescued and elevated to the right hand of Pharaoh, becoming the prime minister of Egypt. Then famine came to Joseph’s homeland of Canaan, and Jacob, Joseph’s father, sent his other sons as emissaries down to Egypt to seek relief. In the process, they met Joseph. They did not recognize him, but Joseph recognized them. What follows is one of the most poignant narratives in the entire Old Testament. The moment of truth came when Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers. They were terrified of his wrath and begged for his forgiveness. Joseph said, “As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good” (Gen. 50:20). What an incredible, incomprehensible biblical revelation that is.*
