### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What is man?
2. What role has God given humans?
3. In what way is Jesus the ultimate human?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.)	

What is man? When we consider the wonder of the creation that God has made, what are humans, frail and weak that we are? The word for man or human being here in v 4 is not the word from which we get the name of the first man, Adam. This word means mankind more generally and the Hebrew word is thought to be derived from a word that means *to be weak or sick*. So, in the *Book of Psalms for Worship*, the line What is man, so frail and weak … is reflecting both the reality of our nature and the word used in the text.

So, what is man? What is a human being? Philosophers might identify a human being as a rational, conscious, ethical, social being with a will and a soul. In our text we are given hints into what man is. Man is one whom God remembers and cares for. We have no clockmaker who wound up the world and simply lets it run. 

Instead, we have God running the world and making mankind the steward of this world. As such, God is placing all things under his feet. The New Testament tells us that it is Jesus Himself, One of mankind, who is the principal ruler over creation. And that *he must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet* (1 Co 15:25).
