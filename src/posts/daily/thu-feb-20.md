### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Tell the story of David and Goliath.
2. Describe Goliath.
3. Who can possibly defeat this huge, powerful enemy?

### Notes

Everybody knows the story of David and Goliath. The idea of a huge enemy being beaten by an undersized champion excites us and gives us hope. You can do a news search on the internet and you will find David and Goliath in many headlines about current events. The story, Keddie reflects, *has been romanticized to such an extent that the residual image in many minds is no more than that of a small, but clever and agile, boy triumphing over a very ungenial giant*. 

The Philistine army had been against Israel all throughout the book of Judges and continuing into Samuel. Here the Philistines gathered their armies for battle against Israel. And with them, a giant champion, Goliath.

Let’s consider this Goliath. He measured six cubits tall plus a span—probably 9 feet 9 inches tall! His armor weighed 125 pounds. And for forty days he stepped forward from the Philistine army and shouted taunts to the Israelite army. His challenge was a one-on-one battle, with the army of the winner enslaving the people of the loser.

And no one in Israel was willing to fight Goliath. Saul, a head taller than the other Israelites. didn’t come forward. His son Jonathan, who had twice attacked the Philistine armies, didn’t come forward. Who can defeat this huge, powerful enemy?
