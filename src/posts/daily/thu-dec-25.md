### Reading

Zephaniah 3:1-8—Woe to Her

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* God’s people are to be pure.
* Sadly, some who claim to be His are not really His.
* Judgment will come on all who are not truly His.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How did God describe his people here?
2. What judgments will God pour out on them?
3. How can we escape God’s judgment?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

While our world at least gives lip service to Jesus’s birth today, we read all through Zephaniah of God’s judgment on her—his people. Yet the two are not separate. Jesus was born at the right time to bring salvation to those who deserve God’s judgment. Jesus also, as we have seen as we look for Christ in these prophets, will come in judgment on all those who rebel against Him.

In our text, God gives warning of judgment against his own people for what she does and for what she fails to do. She is rebellious, polluted, and oppressive. Yet, God has always called on his people to serve Him with gladness, to be pure from the pollution of the nations around them, and to care for the oppressed. Too often, we like ancient Israel, turn these backwards.

Additionally, these who are called by God’s Name, prove that not all are Israel who are of Israel (Rom 9:6). The corresponding danger is that we who are in the church visibly may not all be in the church spiritually. So, either in this life or in the life to come, some will go out from us (the church) because they were not really part of us (see 1 Jn 2:19).

So, are you wearing the name of Jesus in truth, trusting the Savior who was born this day (whichever day that actually was)? Only if you are will you be saved from this woe.
