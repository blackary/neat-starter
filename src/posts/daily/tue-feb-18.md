### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Who was the champion to defeat Goliath?
2. Who was the champion to defeat sin and Satan?
3. What is Jesus, in addition to our champion?

### Notes

Israel desperately needed a champion to defeat Goliath. We desperately need a champion to defeat sin and Satan. Our Champion is who David pointed to—Jesus, David’s greatest Son. 

And this perfect champion who secured our glory and salvation is also our elder brother. Even though we are weak and sinful, even though our sin took Him (willingly) to suffer and die on the cross—in spite of all that—He is not ashamed of us as His brothers! As Kistemaker comments, *the implication is that we, in turn, may call Jesus our brother. What a privilege to be called brothers of the Son of God! He who is seated at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven condescends to sinful man and unashamedly calls him brother (Matt. 28:10; John 20:17)*.

As our brother, Jesus continues His work. The ultimate work is that He will completely undo the wages of sin—that is, death. Kistemaker notes that d*elivering his followers from the curse of sin and the clutches of the devil demanded nothing short of taking the place of those whom God had given him but who stood condemned because of their sin … The result of Christ’s death is twofold: he conquered Satan and set his people free from the fear of death.*

This work of destroying the work of the devil, the power of death, is for us, His brothers and sisters, children of the same flesh that He took on. We have blood ties with our perfect champion!
