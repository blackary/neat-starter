### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What road did Orpah take?
2. What road did Ruth take?
3. How can we get to God?

### Notes

In Ruth 1, we saw Ruth and Noami on the road. They are traveling on the road back to Jerusalem. Naomi tries to get both of her daughters-in-law to go back. Orpah does—returning to her false gods and her people. Ruth, however, insists on following Naomi on the road back to her people, back to her God, the LORD. And, in some way, either before getting on that road, or upon getting on that road, Ruth has come to understand that there is only one right road, only one right way.

Jesus tells his disciples that same thought in our reading. I am the way, he says. People often try different ways. Some try good works. But what will they do with all of their bad works? Others will try a variety of gods and other religions, thinking that there are many ways to God. Jesus leaves no room for doubt, though. No one, he says, comes to the Father except through me.

Hendriksen reminds us that *Jesus does not merely show the way; he is himself the way. It is true that he teaches the way (Mark 12:14; Luke 20:21), guides us in the way (Luke 1:79), and has dedicated for us a new and living way (Heb. 10:20); but all this is possible only because he is himself the way*.

Are you on the road, the way that is Christ?
