* Nahum tells us in the middle of judgment that the LORD is good.
* The LORD is always good.
* The LORD is good to those who take refuge in Him.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. When is the LORD good?
2. To whom is the LORD good?
3. How can we take refuge in the LORD?

### Notes

(See below for all authors. )	

Nahum declares, in the middle of warnings of destruction that the Lord is good. Often when nice things happen to us we exclaim, “God is good!” The danger is that we might think God is good when things are going well, but when things are going pear-shaped, we might not. A family member used to say, including at the death of their twenty-something year-old daughter, “God is good—all the time.” That is a helpful way to remember what Nahum exclaims here. The LORD is good. All the time. 

We know this because God, who cannot lie, tells us so. The LORD, who is great in power and full of faithful love, will not leave the guilty unpunished (v.7, see Ex 34:6–7). And that is a good thing. We don’t want human authorities to randomly let some go unpunished. Imagine if your parents (or boss) allowed someone else to get away with the exact same thing that you were punished for. And here in the middle of God’s description through Nahum of his punishment of Assyria, He declares that He, the LORD, is good.

But is He good for everyone? Does God work all things for good for the entire human race? No. The LORD is good to those who are His—those who take refuge in Him—specifically in His Son, Jesus. Are you His? He is good and will care for you
