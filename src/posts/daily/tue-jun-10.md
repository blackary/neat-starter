### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What does the blessed man in Psalm 1 do?
2. What does the person who loves Jesus do?
3. How does the Holy Spirit help us obey Jesus?

### Notes

Psalm 1 speaks of the blessed man loving God’s law. Loving God’s law demands keeping God’s law. In our reading today, Jesus calls us to show our love of him by obeying his commands. In just a few hours from this time of teaching His disciples, He is going to die. Yet He promises His disciples that because He lives, they will also live. As He has said all along, death could not contain Him. He rose from the dead, then went to His Father just as He has been promising He would do.

And even when He is no longer physically visible, His disciples will, by the promised Holy Spirit, still see Him at work, still experience His presence and His love. And in the Holy Spirit, the required evidence of love for Jesus is possible. For Jesus again says that if we claim to love Him, we must demonstrate that by obeying Him. He couldn’t be clearer. The one who keeps His word loves Him. (v21) The one who loves Him, keeps His word. (v23) The one who doesn’t love Him doesn’t keep His/His Fathers’ word.

Do you love Jesus? Then, with the help of God the Holy Spirit (who lives in you), obey Him. To claim to love Him yet to deliberately disobey Him is to be living a lie. Yet to love Him and demonstrate that love by Holy-Spirit-assisted obedience is to open ourselves up to knowing Jesus’s love to the full.

As we love and obey Jesus, we see and show Jesus in us. As we love and obey Jesus, we know the love of the Father.
