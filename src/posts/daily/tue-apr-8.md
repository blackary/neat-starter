### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *book* and *life*.

### Reading

Revelation 20:11-15—Written in the book of life

### Optional Reading

1 Chron 9:1–21

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* There will be a final judgment by God of all people.
* One book will have everything everyone has done.
* The book of life records everyone who believes in Jesus.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What is the book of life?
2. How do we get our name written in the book of life?
3. What happens to those whose names are not written in the book of life?

### Notes

Chronicles records a book of God’s record. But the Bible tells us there are other books of God’s record. Here in the book of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, we see a book of life. This book of life is referenced in Psalm 69:28, Philippians 4:3, and 6 times in Revelation. This book of life, from these descriptions, is a book of those who have been granted eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. 

The CSB notes state that *there are two sets of books at this judgment. The names of all believers are in the book of life. The names of the “earth dwellers” are not in the book of life (13:8; 17:8). They are judged according to their works, which are recorded in the other books*. 

While your name might not be found in Chronicles (and even if it is, it was not written about you) if you are a Christian, your name is found in the book of life. The RSB notes that *this book is the heavenly roster of those destined to new life through the purchase of Christ’s blood (3:5; 5:9)*.

On the other hand, terrifyingly, anyone whose name is not written in the book of life is thrown into the lake of fire—what we know to be hell—eternal just punishment from the Holy God. Where is your name written?
