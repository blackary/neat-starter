* God reveals his gospel even to infants as he wants to.
* Jesus invites us to come to him.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What is Jesus’s invitation in our text?
2. What is Jesus’s heart like, by his own claim?
3. Should we do what is on our heart? Explain.

### Notes

In 2 Samuel 7, David desires to build God’s house. Nathan the prophet says, *Do all that is in your heart, the Lord is with you*. Is that the way we should think now? In a qualified way, yes. If we belong to the Lord and are living in step with the Lord—if our delight is in the Lord, then more and more our desires are going to be in step with the Lord’s desires. 

Jesus has just pronounced severe judgment on those who rejected him. Now, in our text, he praises God’s sovereignty in hiding or revealing the truth of the gospel. Then he invites all who hear him to come to him. We can leave for now the mystery of the harmony between God’s sovereignty and our responsibility. Let us consider Jesus invitation.

First, Jesus says, come. Come to me. If you are weary, if you are burdened, come. I will give rest. As we pray for people to come, we can pray that they will recognize their weariness and come to Jesus.

Second, Jesus calls those who come to learn from him. This is consistent with his great commission where he tells his disciples to make disciples, baptizing them and teaching them all he has commanded. Might we learn from Jesus and teach others about him.

In this context, Jesus identifies his heart. I am, he says, gentle and lowly in heart. Ultimately, if we are going to follow our heart in the right way, we need to have the heart of Jesus.
