### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. For whom do all things work together for good?
2. How do we know if we love God?
3. What is God’s goal in His saving work in us?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

All things work together for good. Full stop. For everyone. Always. I mean, that’s what the Bible says, right? No, sorry, that’s not exactly what the Bible says. But what the Bible says is actually better—for some people—and it is a sweet call to others to turn in love to God. 

Romans 8:28 is often quoted. You will see it on sympathy cards, on social media memes, and the like. But often the first phrase is all that is quoted: “We know that all things work together for good.” But the verse has two parallel qualifiers to the “all things.”

First, this promise is for the good of everyone who loves God. Do you love God? Some evidence that the Bible gives is that: you obey His commands, love God’s people, and trust His son for the righteousness that you need but can’t produce. If you love God, then this promise is for you.

The second qualifier is that this promise is for everyone who is called according to God’s purpose. This qualifier is parallel to the first one, because we only love God because He calls us to love Him. We love because He first loved us. He does in us His saving work of foreknowing us, predestining us, calling us, justifying us, and glorifying us. So, no matter what happens, if you love God it will work for good—eventually and ultimately for good. Even if it kills you, that is ultimately good because to die and be with Christ is better by far.
