### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *complete* or *completely*.

### Reading

Nahum 1:8-15—The Lord Will Completely Destroy His Enemies.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* God will completely destroy Nineveh (Assyria).
* God will completely destroy all His enemies.
* Any affliction from the evil one or evil ones will eventually end.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How much will God destroy Assyria?
2. How much will God destroy all of his enemies?
3. What will come when all God’s and our enemies are destroyed?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

God’s judgment toward Ninevah would be a complete destruction. And as Nahum prophesied, so it happened. As Redmond reports, *Babylonia would eventually become the superior aggressor who would take down the Neo-Assyrian Empire by sacking Nineveh in 612 BC and finally eliminating Assyria in 609 BC.*

Yet God will not stop with Nineveh. He will chase *all* his enemies into darkness. Eventually Babylon will also be destroyed. Jeremiah notes that *suddenly Babylon fell and was shattered (51:8)*. And Daniel writes of God setting up a kingdom that will not be destroyed and will crush all other kingdoms (Dan 2). That Kingdom is, of course, the Kingdom of God, and her King is Jesus.

For God’s people of Nahum’s day, and for God’s people today, this promise brings comfort and hope. One day all will be made right. One day no evil rulers will have any power. One day no evil will have any power. 

In the meantime, we live in hope. We believe God that he will completely destroy his and our enemies. As Miller assures, *in terms similar to Isaiah 40:1–2, the Lord speaks comforting words to his people. Because of their sin, God had afflicted them with the rod of Assyria, but now Assyria would be judged, and Judah would no longer be afflicted. The years of suffering under Assyria’s oppression had come to an end*. One day any affliction we may suffer will also come to an end. And the glory to come will be incomparable!
