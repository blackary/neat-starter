### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why was the Jews’ charge of blasphemy against Jesus wrong?
2. How did Jesus refute that charge?
3. What do we know about the Bible?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on Romans by Richard D. Phillips)	

*Jesus refuted the charge of blasphemy in a way that is hard for us to follow today. … The Jews were basing their accusation on the Scriptures, so Jesus exposed their inability to handle the Scriptures rightly. He quotes Psalm 82:6, a psalm of rebuke to the unjust judges of Israel. The full verse reads: “I said, ‘You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you.’ ” Some people, such as the Mormons, use Jesus’ quotation of this verse to argue that all believers will ultimately become gods. But this is a preposterous interpretation. Rather, the psalm acknowledges that the judges of ancient Israel ruled with God’s authority. They were as gods among the people, fulfilling a holy task on God’s behalf. The point of the psalm is not to exalt these human rulers, but to threaten them for their unjust ways. “You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince” (Ps. 82:6–7). …* 

*We should note the high claim that Jesus makes about the Scriptures. He refers to the Old Testament as “the word of God” and asserts that “Scripture cannot be broken” (John 10:35)—that is, it cannot be refuted or set aside. He bases his whole defense on one word in a single psalm. This affirms the authority of every single word in the Bible as being inspired from God himself.*
