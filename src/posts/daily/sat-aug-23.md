### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *hope*.

### Reading

Lamentations 3:19-24 I Will Put My Hope in Him!

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jeremiah remembers God is faithful.
* Jeremiah knows God is enough.
* Jeremiah puts his hope in his faithful God.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What does Jeremiah remember about God’s faithfulness?
2. What does Jeremiah remember about God?
3. What happens when Jeremiah remembers these things?

### Notes

(See below for all authors)	

We continue the statements of powerful hope in the middle of laments, woe, and distress. God’s mercies keep me from being consumed. God’s compassions are new every morning. And…


**God’s faithfulness is great**. It is abounding. It is exceeding. 	No matter what my circumstances, my God is faithful. Do you believe these three things? Do you remember them? If you haven’t, I urge you to memorize Lamentations 3:21-23 (or even 20-26) Verse 24 sums up the response to v22-23.


**The Lord is my portion**. I will hope in Him. Sometimes when being served food, especially at a large gathering with lots of people, we might wonder, “Will I get a big enough portion?” God gives himself to us—generously. He is our portion. (see Ps 16:5). Calvin reminds us that *we cannot stand firm in adversities, except we be content with God alone and his favour.* Is God enough for your soul? Are you fully persuaded that God alone is enough?

If not, you’ll have great difficulty weathering the storms of life. Whether trouble comes as a result of God’s discipline for particular sin, or as a general result of living in a fallen world, God must be your satisfying portion. He is enough.

### Praise

Psalm 16d, 85a

### Prayer

1. Confess with your family that the Lord is enough. Pray you always remember that.
2. Pray for the reading and preaching of God’s word tomorrow.
3. Pray for a member of our church, for your family, and for a non-Christian friend/family member.
