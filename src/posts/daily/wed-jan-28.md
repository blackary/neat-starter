### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What do we know about Amos?
2. What were Israel’s sins?
3. How can God both be just and justify the guilty?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

Amos was a farmer whom God sent from the Kingdom of Judah to prophecy to the Kingdom of Israel. Amos came to Israel with a prophecy of Judgment. Throughout its history, Israel had served other Gods and set up illegitimate places of worship, called “high places.”  The poor were oppressed by the rich. Amos made it clear that God had seen the wickedness of Israel and would surely punish Israel. But Amos also spoke of God’s mercy and grace. God would not totally destroy the house of Jacob.

Amos 9:8 is a turning point in the book. It summarizes God’s assessment of and coming judgment on Israel. These themes dominate the book before this verse. It also looks forward to God’s restoration of Israel, which is fleshed out in the remainder of the book.

God sees and Amos records Israel’s injustice—oppression of the poor and needy, sexual immorality, and religious observance without obedience.

God executes justice. He will not simply turn the other way in the face of injustice. God’s judgment on the wicked is also an expression of love for those oppressed by them. And Israel’s illegitimate places of worship would be destroyed.

However, God shows mercy in His justice. God is not merely a God who executes justice, He is also a God of mercy. His law condemns us, but in Christ He has shown us mercy.
