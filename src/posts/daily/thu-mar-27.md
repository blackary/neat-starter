### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *Elisha*

### Reading

2 Kings 4:1-7, 38-44—Multiplication of Miracles.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Elisha, like Elijah, did many miracles.
* The miracles point us to the power of God.
* The miracles point us to Jesus.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What miracle worker are we to follow?
2. How can miracles happen?
3. What are three things these miracles tell us about God?

### Notes

We come now to one of the two main “speaking prophets” in 2 Kings. Both Elijah and Elisha are miracle workers whose lives and ministries in many ways point to our Savior. And, as with all Old Testament saints, they are presented to us as examples. However, far more than following these saints, we are to follow Jesus.

Elisha followed after Elijah. Before Elijah was taken up into heaven (2:11-12), Elisha had asked for a double portion of Elijah’s spirit to be put on himself. While the full significance of that is unclear, by many counts we have recorded twice as many miracles by Elisha as by Elijah.

Two of the three miracles in our text today are multiplying miracles. The widow’s oil was multiplied so she could sell it and pay her debts. The barley loaves were multiplied to feed one hundred men. Ellsworth notes that *the miracles of the Lord are intended to point us to the God of the miracles. We are to look beyond them to the Lord himself. The miracles of the purified stew and the multiplied food drive us to draw three conclusions. God is real and living. God can do the impossible. God has genuine compassion for human need*.

Do you believe these things about God?
