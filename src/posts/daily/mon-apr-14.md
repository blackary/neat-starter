* Moses saw a bush burning.
* God spoke to Moses from this bush.
* God called Moses to serve him.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What was remarkable about this burning bush?
2. What did God tell Moses to not do and to do?
3. What 3 lessons can we learn from God's call to Moses?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on Exodus by Michael Bentley)	*In this chapter I want us to examine the call of Moses and see what we can learn from it about how God calls people to serve him today. The first thing to notice is that it is God’s work which matters, not what we want.*

*Second, the Lord calls people to do his work. He does not call men or women to serve him so that they can feel important. Neither does he call people so that they can be praised by everyone for the good work they have done. God not only calls prominent people to work for him; he calls ‘all sorts and conditions of men’ and women to fulfil his purposes. …*

*A third lesson which we can learn from the life of Moses is that before God calls a person to serve him, he equips him or her for the task. We have seen this illustrated in the previous two chapters, where we saw that the first part of Moses’ preparation took place when he was in the palace in Egypt, and the second while he was a shepherd in the desert. For forty years he had been a prince in Egypt; he had everything that money could buy, and people took notice of what he said. Now he was a ‘nobody’. Not only that, but for large stretches of time his only companions were sheep. Moses lived the life of a shepherd, as David was to do many years later.*
