### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

At times in this fallen world in which we live, we might hear of a shelter-in-place warning (sometimes called lockdown, though the two are not identical). The idea is don’t go out, stay where you are, and, sometimes, do whatever you can to seal up access from outside. As Psalm 5 ends, having spoken of God’s judgment on the wicked, the Psalmist concludes a call to shelter in God. That is, he will delight in God being his refuge. And he calls all who love God to do the same. And, if we are in Christ, God is our refuge, we can shelter in Him.

Three words are used here to describe God’s care. Shelter, as we have already discussed, carries the sense of a place of protection or a covering of protection. Refuge is also a place of protection from danger. Finally, God surrounds us with His favor. In Christ, as we shelter in God, we are triply protected. Psalm 91:4 uses one different word but still speaks of this triple protection.

Let’s remember, no matter what the wicked are doing, even toward us, we are triply protected by, as Kidner puts it, *God’s encircling, providential care*. Since we trust God, we don’t need to be afraid, and when we are afraid, we renew our trust in God. (see Psalm 56:3-4).
