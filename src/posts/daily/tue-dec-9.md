1. What are the 4 rhetorical questions?
2. What is the answer to each?
3. How beautiful are your feet?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	 

If people are going to confess and believe and be saved from God’s avenging wrath, how is it going to happen? What will be the chain of events for a person to call on the name of the Lord and be saved? 

How will they call on the Lord if they don’t believe in Him? (They won’t.) And while the Bible makes clear that coming to believe in Him is God’s gift, there is in God’s plan a very important human part—as the next question addresses.

How will they believe if they haven’t heard of Jesus? Again, the implied answer “They won’t” points out how important it is that we believers are telling other people about Jesus. 

That is the sense of the 3rd question. How will they hear if no one tells them? God could save people directly, but he has chosen to use weak, sinful, faulty Christians to tell others about Jesus. Have you told anyone lately?

The last question tells us that the preachers have to be sent. Since Pentecost, preachers have been sent all over the world (including to their next-door neighbors) so people will hear of Him. The Bible makes it clear there is formal sending for formally called preachers and informal sending for those who are saved, to talk about the gospel wherever they go.

Those sent preachers, God says, have beautiful feet because they can be seen running hard to others to tell this good news.
