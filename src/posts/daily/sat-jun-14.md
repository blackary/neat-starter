### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *call*. 

### Reading

Proverbs 1:20-33—Wisdom Calls Out in the Street

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Wisdom, as a person, calls out for us to listen.
* Those who don’t listen are fools.
* Seek wisdom in Jesus Christ.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Who is the Person of Wisdom?
2. Who is Wisdom calling to?
3. When is it too late to listen to Wisdom?

### Notes

Proverbs personifies wisdom. That is, wisdom is not just talked about as an idea, but as a person. And, although Proverbs presents this person of wisdom as a “she,” we know that ultimately the Per-son of wisdom is He—our Lord and Savior, Jesus. 1 Cor 1:30

This wisdom caller in Proverbs, the RSB notes, *is portrayed as an open-air preacher similar to the caller in Isaiah 55. Personified as a woman, she calls on the simple to repent of folly and to seek wisdom before it is too late*. 

Wisdom calls to various sorts of people: to the inexperienced or naïve to not love ignorance, to the mocker or scoffer to listen instead of scorning wisdom, to the fool who is too lazy to seek wisdom and to a more hardened fool (two different words are used for the fool in Proverbs) who hates wisdom, to love and seek wisdom before it’s too late.

The RSB notes, *true wisdom is an aspect of God’s saving grace, and there comes a point of no return for those who reject it. This truth reinforces the urgency of the message. No one can expect God’s favor and at the same time scorn the gifts He offers (Deut. 1:45; 1 Sam. 28:6; Ps. 18:41)*.
