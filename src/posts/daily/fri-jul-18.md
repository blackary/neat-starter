* God never tempts anyone.
* God gives good gifts to his children.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What is the difference between trials and temptations?
2. What causes our temptations?
3. What good gifts does God give?

### Notes

(See last page for authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on James by Gordon Keddie)	

*There is a sense in which persevering under trials is its own reward—although, as we shall see in a moment, it is far from being all of the reward. The man who ‘perseveres under trial’ is described as ‘blessed’. The present tense of the verb indicates that there is joy for the one who is faithful in the act of persevering while the trials are upon him. He endures and, as he endures, he conquers! He doesn’t just, as the Scots say, ‘thole it’—i.e., put up with it, tough it out, suffer through or grit his teeth and bear it. ‘The wicked man suffers; he does not “endure”, in the Scripture sense of the word.’ Christian joy is not merely future; it is a present experience even in this vale of tears.*

*When you think about it, trials and temptations are inseparably linked with one another. … James’ discussion of temptation goes right to the heart of the matter. How do we respond to temptation? Who is responsible for temptation? What is the nature and what are the consequences of temptation? Upon the answers to these questions hangs the very reality of our relationship to the living God.*

*To try to excuse our sins by shifting the blame onto God, in whatever way we choose to do this, is the crime of lèse-majesté—it is treason against the righteous lordship of God. There is only one person responsible for the temptations into which we fall. As the prophet Nathan said to David, over the sin with Bathsheba, so God says to us in rebuke of our sins, ‘You are the man!’ (2 Samuel 12:7).*
