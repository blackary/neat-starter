### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

The first Lord’s Day in my ministry as full-time pastor of Springs Reformed Church I preached about loving God and your neighbor. I said, 	If I could sum up in a sentence what I hope from you as a congregation in being your pastor, it would be that you love the Lord your God with all of your heart and soul and mind and strength, and that you love your neighbor as yourself. That’s still my hope.

Of course, you can only love God because of his great love for you. Christ died for sinners because of God's love for sinners! What is love? Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins (1 John 4:10 CSB). In response to God’s love, you prove your love for God by keeping his commands. 

That was the problem of the prophet Joel’s audience. They claimed to love God but were not obeying his commands. Instead, our attitude should be, “Because of the saving grace of God, I now—imperfectly to be sure, but certainly—desire to love God and desire to demonstrate my love for God by obeying his commands.” And when I fail, I repent. I remember the love of God to me as demonstrated in the gospel. And I resolve again to seek again to love the Lord my God with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my strength, and with all my mind.
