### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *grieve* and *joy*.

### Reading

Nehemiah 8:9-12—Don’t Grieve

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* People wept as they heard the Word read and preached.
* Instead, they were encouraged to have joy.
* So they celebrated the Lord’s goodness together.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why were the people weeping?
2. What was to be the source of their strength?
3. How did the people then respond?

### Notes

As God’s word was read and explained, the people listening began to weep. It seems likely that the powerful, living and active Word of God was cutting them to the heart—exposing their sin. Yet they were commanded not to mourn and grieve. This day was a holy day to the Lord. While we shouldn’t conclude from that that we can’t ever weep in response to the Word read and preached on the Lord’s Day, we do know, as Benn points out. that *Ezra knew that the people needed to be directed toward the joy of the forgiveness that God brings to those who truly repent and believe in his mercy and grace. The people were no doubt tired by now, as well as being emotionally moved and drained. So Ezra and the Levites sent them to eat, celebrate, and share their resources with those less able to do so, with the great truth that “the joy of the Lord is your strength” ringing in their ears (8:10)*.

While commentators differ on this phrase, we do find God expressing joy and delight in his people throughout the Bible. Knowing that God finds joy in me is certainly a reason for finding strength. Jesus tells of faithful servants who were invited to enter into (or share in) their master’s joy (Matthew 25:20-23).

Even when God’s word exposes your sin, never forget that it also exposes your Savior. And in your Lord’s joy, find strength and joy.
