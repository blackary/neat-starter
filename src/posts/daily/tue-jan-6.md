* Jesus was full of zeal for God’s house, the temple.
* Jesus also is the true temple.
* Jesus’s glory is in God’s house, His church.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How would the rebuilt temple have more glory?
2. In what ways did the temple point to Jesus?
3. How is God’s glory seen in Jesus’s church?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	 

God promises, through Haggai, that the glory of the temple that the Jews returned from exile are building will be greater than the temple that Solomon built. How could this be?

Because Jesus, the true temple, would bodily stand in this rebuilt temple. He would preach peace as the Prince of Peace.

Torry reflects that *whoever compares the description of the temple of Solomon, in the first book of Kings, with the most splendid accounts of the second temple, however adorned with costly stones and other magnificent decorations in after ages, must perceive that the former, being wholly overlaid with pure gold, was incomparably more glorious than the latter in its greatest magnificence … In nothing, in fact, could the second temple excel the first in glory, except in the personal presence of ‘the Desire of all nations,’ He who is ‘the glory of the Lord,’ and the true temple, ‘in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,’ and who was the true Shechinah, of which that of Solomon’s temple was merely a type*. 

That rebuilt temple has long been torn down. However, Jesus, the One to whom the temple pointed, continues to work in His church for His own glory.
