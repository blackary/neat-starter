3. How can we keep our eyes on Jesus?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on Hebrews by Kent Hughes.)	

*In capping his famous challenge to finish well, the writer \[of Hebrews] gives the idea of focusing on Jesus a dynamic twist by concluding: “Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart” (v. 3). The phrase “grow weary and lose heart” was sports lingo in the ancient world for a runner’s exhausted collapse. Thus, the way for the Christian runner to avoid such a spiritual collapse was to “consider him”—that is, to carefully calculate (we derive our word logarithm from the Greek word translated “consider”) Jesus and his endurance of opposition from the likes of Caiaphas, Herod and Pilate. We are to remember his confidence and meekness and steel-like strength in meeting his enemies.*

*No one can miss the superb wisdom of this passage: we must be totally absorbed with Jesus. This requires negation—turning away from those things that distract us—and then the positive act of consciously focusing and meditating on Jesus. This is why we must read and re-read the Gospels. This is why our worship must be Christocentric. This is why he must be the measure of all things. …*

*We must focus on Jesus as “the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.” Jesus must cover the entire sky. He must be the center and horizons of our sight. Such vision will insure for us faith’s beginning and end. We must consider him and how he lived amidst contradiction and follow his example.*
