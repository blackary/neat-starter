* Bad choices can have bad results
* Moab was an enemy of God’s people

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why did Elimelech and Noami move to Moab?
2. Should they have? Why or why not?
3. Why did Mahlon and Chilion marry Moabite wives?
4. Should they have? Why or why not?

### Notes

The little book of Ruth tells a big story—a story of failure, hardship, restoration, even redemption. We begin during the time of the Judges. Bethlehem was under famine—maybe all the land of Israel. We meet four people: Elimelech and his delightful wife, Naomi (Naomi means *my delight*), and their two sons, Mahlon and Chilion.

Because of the famine, they move to Moab. Moab was Israel’s enemy. Their king had hired Balaam to curse Israel during their wanderings. Although God kept the Israelites from harming Moab (Deut 2:9) he also barred any Moabite from entering the assembly of the Lord (Deut 23:3). And God forbade his people from marrying Moabites (1 Ki 11:1-2).

Yet Elimelech and Naomi moved there. Elimelech died. Mahlon and Chilion married Moabite wives. Mahlon and Chilion died. It was a bitter ten years for Naomi!

Can we say for sure that these bad results were the direct result of bad choices? No! We do not know God’s sovereign will. But if we make bad choices, bad results should not surprise us. And our focus must not be on whether Elimelech and Noami and their sons were more sinful than others, including us. Instead we must remember to repent of our sin—our bad choices. *If we confess our sin, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us from all un-righteousness* (1 Jn 1:9).
