### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

As we think about Jesus’s humiliation on the cross, how should that impact us? We must mourn our treatment of Jesus. Our treatment—not just the Jews and Romans of Jesus’s day. Pilot, a Roman governor ruling over Judea, represented the nations. The Jewish leaders should have recognized the Messiah and promised King, but instead urged the crowd to call out crucify him! But had we been there, apart from the grace and truth granted to us by Jesus, we would have joined in the call, crucify him!

Though Jesus is full of grace and truth, he was despised and rejected by men. The whole Roman cohort gathered around to beat and mock Him. This would have been somewhere between 480 and 600 men. Making a clamor. Intending to prolong Jesus’s agony. Flogging him with nine strands of cord which contained sharp pieces of bone or metal and lead balls tied to the end. The scourging would rip the victim’s back apart exposing muscle and bone. This was the lashing of a fool yet received by the perfect Jesus.

He took this beating for your healing. He was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on him, and we are healed by his wounds Isa 53:5.
