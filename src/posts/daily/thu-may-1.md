### *Listen up, little ones*

Listen for the name *Cyrus*.

### Reading

Ezra 1:1-4—Cyrus, God’s Anointed Servant

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Cyrus was king of Persia who defeated Babylon.
* Isaiah spoke of Cyrus, by name, 100 years before Cyrus was born.
* God can use sinners to carry out his will.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What do we know about Cyrus from the Bible?
2. What did Cyrus do here for the Jewish people?
3. How can God use sinners to do his will?

### Notes

As we noted earlier, the end of 2 Chronicles and the beginning of Ezra are nearly identical, word-for-word. This Cyrus is, as Ezra notes, the king of Persia. God brought Babylon to take the people into captivity for their rebellion against Him. When King Cyrus of Persia conquered Babylon in 538 B.C., he issued a proclamation that the Jewish people could return to their homeland and rebuild God’s house. Evers notes that *the journey to Judah was the outcome of a decree issued by the Persian king, Cyrus, but behind this edict was the plan of the sovereign God, who was preparing the Jewish race for the coming of Christ, the Saviour of the world*.

So, other than the King of Persia, who is this Cyrus? We first encounter him here and at the end of Chronicles. He interacts with the rebuilding Jews throughout Ezra. The prophets Isaiah and Daniel also speak of Him. Isaiah, however, speaks of Cyrus, by name, some 100 years before his birth! This unbelieving king is called by God through Isaiah “my shepherd” and “the LORD’s anointed.” Unbelievable! Both that Isaiah called him by name generations before he was born and that the almighty God would use an unbeliever in this way. But God did. So we must believe it!
