### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What are we told about Hosea in v. 1?
2. Why do we call the Minor Prophets minor?
3. What did Israel do against God?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

Hosea is the first of what we call The Minor Prophets—the last 12 books in the Old Testament of our English Bibles. They are not called minor because of value or importance—merely because of length. Hosea is both the first and the longest of the 12.

Hosea served some 40-60 years toward the end of the Northern Kingdom, Israel. His prophecy is directed primarily at Israel, although Fee/Stuart note that `even though Hosea seems to pay only passing attention to Judah in his oracles (see 1:7, 11; 4:15; 5:5, 10, 12–14; 6:4, 11; 8:14; 10:11; 11:12; 12:2), he will not expect his later Judean readers to do the same regarding Judah—nor should we who now read it from the hindsight of the fall of both kingdoms!`

Smith comments that *in the days of the great Jeroboam II God raised up another mighty prophet. Through personal tragedy in his own life Hosea son of Beeri learned the pain which Israel’s waywardness caused Yahweh. The first three chapters introduce the major themes of the entire book. Israel’s sin is grievous, like adultery. Israel’s punishment is certain. Yet beyond the judgment there was hope for a glorious future.*

Hoshea, not to be confused with Hosea, was king when Assyria captured Israel. This happened because Israel sinned against God and worshipped other gods. May we not turn against God this way.
