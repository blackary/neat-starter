### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What did God promise about David’s son’s kingdom?
2. Who is the eternal King?
3. What happens when people submit to Jesus?

### Notes

God promised David that he would have a line of kings from his offspring. We can read about many of these kings in the Old Testament. But as significant as that kingly line was, God promised David more. In fact, God promised David’s Son an eternal kingdom.

The New Testament makes clear that Jesus is that eternal king and his kingdom is that promised eternal kingdom. Matthew’s gospel quotes from Micah that a ruler would come from Bethlehem (Matt 2:6), and from Isaiah and Zechariah that the king would ride into Jerusalem (Matt 21:5). The charge put over Jesus’s cross was that he was the king of the Jews Matt 27:37).

And the New Testament church believed this. In our text today we see that those who opposed the church said two significant things about this church. 1. They were turning the world upside down. (Do we so believe God and live for Jesus that people say that about us?) 2. These Christians were claiming another king than Caesar—Jesus. It’s not just that one day Jesus will be king. Jesus is king.

Keddie notes that *the gospel is meant to transform the world. Christ is declared the Lord not only of individuals and the church, of inward piety and the corporate worship of God’s people. He is Lord of the nations themselves!* Jesus is the eternal king!
