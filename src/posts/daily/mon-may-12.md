### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What does John tell us about the Word?
2. What does it mean that Jesus is the Word?
3. Why should we listen to the Word read and preached?

### Notes

In Nehemiah 8 we saw God’s people receive God’s Word read and preached. They received it devotedly, eagerly, attentively, reverently, joyfully, obediently, and yearningly. How do you receive the Word read and preached? And why does it matter?

One major reason it matters is that Jesus is the Word. John introduces Jesus as the Word in the beginning, the Word that was with God, the Word that is God, and the Word that became flesh. John also identifies Jesus as the Word in the final book in our Bibles, the Revelation of Jesus Christ (Rev 19:3) when he comes as the conquering King.

Hendriksen notes that *a word serves two distinct purposes: a. it gives expression to the inner thought, the soul of the man … and b. it reveals this thought (hence, the soul of the speaker) to others. Christ is the Word of God in both respects: he expresses or reflects the mind of God; also, he reveals God to man*.

If we combine John’s descriptions of Jesus as the Word with Jesus’s own testimony that all of the Scriptures are about him (Luke 24:27, 44), then we have the greatest motive we can have to give attention to the reading and preaching of the Bible—in it (all of it) we learn about Jesus.
