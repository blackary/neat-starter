### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How are Psalm 3 and 4 alike?
2. How could the Psalmist sleep in peace?
3. How could Jesus sleep in peace?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	 

Psalms 3 and 4 have many connecting ideas. Foes (Ps 3:1) are related to the word for distress (Ps 4:1). Many are saying troubling things in both Ps 3:2 and 4:6. Glory (Ps 3:3) and honor (Ps 4:2) are the same word in Hebrew. Both Psalms also speak of sleep—specifically sleeping peacefully despite enemies and troubles. Wilcock points out that *\[in Psalm 3, David] sleeps and reawakens, \[In Psalm 4] he lies down again to sleep, and the two psalms may be contrasted as a morning prayer and an evening one; but each is a cry to God which expects an answer.*

Sometimes we may face foes. Sometimes we may have trouble sleeping. Jesus, too, faced many enemies. Yet, as Eveson reminds us, *at no time was Jesus ruffled by the enemy. He could sleep any time, anywhere, even in a boat with a storm raging. After the enemies had done their worst, Jesus committed his spirit to his Father and awoke on the resurrection morning*.

These two Psalms, and the confidence in the Lord of which David is certain, ought to be a comfort and encouragement to us. Jesus’s saving work ought to be even more of a comfort and encouragement. Because I am His, I can sleep in peace. When I wake up, I am still with Him and He with me.
