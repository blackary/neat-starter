### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *vanity* or *futility*.

### Reading

Ecclesiastes 1:1-11 Vanity of Vanities

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Life is short.
* Then we die.
* So live the life God has given you.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How would you define vanity or futility?
2. How long will your life be?
3. How should you live?

### Notes

<div><small><i>I am drawing heavily from David Gibson’s Living Life Backward in the notes for Thu-Sat this week.</i></small></div>

In this complicated book of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher (likely Solomon, but it’s uncertain) examines life. Life is short. Gibson states that *you know what happens when you blow out a candle. How long does the puff of smoke last? You can smell it and see it. It’s very real. But it is also transient, temporary, and vanishes quickly. It comes and goes without a permanent impact or a lasting impression on the world*.

For many of us, the older we get, the briefer life seems. “Just yesterday” we were doing this or that—in school, our first job, when we first married, holding our first child. Life is short. Death will be here before we know it. *For you are like vapor that appears for a little while, then vanishes* (James 4:14 CSB).

If the reality is that life is short and then you die, how then should we live? Gibson suggests that *the reality is, we spend our lives trying to escape the constraints of our created condition. Opening our eyes to this is a significant breakthrough. To be human is to be a creature, and to be a creature is to be finite. We are not God. We are not in control, and we will not live forever. … the Preacher is going to show us what we should, and should not, expect out of life. He is not just saying there’s no gain after we’ve chased the wind; he will insist there’s no need for the chase in the first place. There is no gain to be had under the sun, and that’s precisely the point. None need be sought.*
