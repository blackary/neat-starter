<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *do* and *done*.

### Reading

1 Corinthians 16:13-14—The gospel overcomes every boundary

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* All Christians have a common bond.
* The gospel tells us about this common bond.
* The gospel IS this common bond.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why do we need the common bond of the gospel?
2. How are we to live as a result of this common bond?
3. What differences cannot be overcome by the gospel?

### Notes

Today’s notes are from a commentary on 1 Corinthians by Stephen T. Um.

*The first characteristic of this common bond is that it is reinforced by gospel truth. “Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong” (v. 13). Paul says “Be watchful’ ” in order to provide a word of caution for the Corinthians to remain alert and to have their hope engaged for the return of the Lord who will make all things right. The verse further reads, “Stand firm in the faith.” This is shorthand for believing the core doctrines of Christianity. “Faith” is a call to mind the historical realities of what God has done for them in Christ. He is saying, “Make the gospel one of your core values.” In the following commands, “Act like men, be strong” Paul is not contrasting masculinity and femininity, but fullgrownness and childlikeness. In 13:11 we read, “When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.” The gospel is to be central to all that the Corinthians say and do. Their present situation (which includes uncertainty, the lack of a trustworthy leader, and the doctrinal mess they are in) should not distract them from growing into maturity. Nothing can hold them together apart from the gospel. Personal interests, tastes, preferences, and desires are not grounds for any kind of true, lasting unity. The gospel, which is for everyone regardless of background, overcomes every boundary present in other human communities.*
