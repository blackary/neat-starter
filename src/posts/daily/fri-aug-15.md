### Reading

Jeremiah 33:14-18—A Righteous Branch

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* God promises a Righteous Branch.
* This Righteous Branch is Jesus.
* In Jesus, the Lord is our Righteousness.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What are we told about this Righteous Branch?
2. How can we have righteousness?
3. On what basis does God grant the work of this Righteous Branch to us?

### Notes

Again, Jeremiah is offered hope from God even in the midst of discipline. This hope is on the basis of God’s faithfulness to his covenant promises to David. The fulfilment of this promise is in the Righteousness Branch. Jeremiah first heard from God about this Righteous Branch in 23:5. 

We are told that this Righteous Branch will spring up, will execute righteousness and judgment, will save Judah, and will give Jerusalem security. In chapter 23 we are told that this branch will reign wisely as king. There we are told that his name is the LORD our Righteousness. Yet in a stunning display of grace, here in chapter 33 we are told, as Harrison notes, *the new name of Jerusalem, representing all Judea, will be The LORD our righteousness, showing that she is finally exemplifying covenant holiness*.

Indeed, if the LORD is not your righteousness, then you have no righteousness at all. On the other hand, if the Righteous Branch is your Lord and King, then you are righteous in the LORD indeed!
