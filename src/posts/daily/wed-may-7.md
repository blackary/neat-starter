### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How did Ezra prepare for the rebuilt temple’s beauty?
2. How does Jesus make his church beautiful?
3. Who is Jesus’s bride?

### Notes

In Ezra, Cyrus and his officials returned to the Jewish exiles over 5,000 beautiful items of gold and silver that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple before destroying it (and all of Jerusalem). In this way, Cyrus was providing for the beauty of the rebuilt temple.

In our reading today, we learn about husbands and wives. But we learn more about Jesus and his church. We find out that Jesus, a greater anointed one than Cyrus, cares about making his temple, his body, his church beautiful. But Jesus doesn’t use gold and silver items to make his church beautiful. 

Instead, he washes her clean with His word. Remember that if you are a Christian, you are part of the her who is Jesus’s beautiful bride. He removes spots and wrinkles. He makes her holy. Hendriksen notes that *it is the bridegroom himself, even Christ, who here in 5:27 is described as preparing the one who one day will be manifested as his bride, so that she will be “brilliant in purity.” … It is the bridegroom himself, even Christ, who here in 5:27 is described as preparing the one who one day will be manifested as his bride, so that she will be “brilliant in purity.”*

Jesus is making his bride, his church, beautiful. For all of us who are Christians, Jesus is making us (individually and together) beautiful!
