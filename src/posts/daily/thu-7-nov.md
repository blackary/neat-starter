### Reading

Luke 24:13-35 – Burning Hearts

### Notes

How do you react to the reading of the Bible? Is it ordinary or explosive? More of the same—or something new and exciting? Information to think about? Or news to change who you are and how you live? We should all hope that it is explosive, new and exciting, and that it changes us—every time. But we know that it isn’t always and doesn’t always. For these two disciples, their encounter with the risen Jesus and their understanding of the Scriptures from his explanation left their hearts burning. 

Bock comments, *with a flame relit in their hearts, they return to the gathering of disciples in Jerusalem. The news is too good to keep to themselves. To know Jesus is to be thrilled at the prospect of sharing news of him with others*.

Our Westminster Larger Catechism asks this question: Q160.	*What is required of those who hear the word preached*? And answers this way: 	*It is required of those who hear the word preached that they attend on it with diligence, preparation and prayer; examine by the Scriptures what they hear; receive the truth with faith, love, meekness and readiness of mind as the word of God; meditate on and discuss it; hide it in their hearts, and bring forth its fruit in their lives.* Might we respond this way, with the Lord’s help. Oh, that Jesus would, by his Spirit, leave our hearts burning every time we consider his word.
