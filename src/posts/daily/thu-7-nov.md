### Reading

Luke 24:13-33 – Jesus in all the Scriptures.

### Notes

For the New Testament writers, with only one possible exception, the Scriptures means to them what we call the Old Testament. If the Lord is willing, over the next several months, we will be considering Christ in the Old Testament. My plan is to preach each week from a chapter in each book in the Old Testament looking for Christ. Why would we do that? Because, as we read in v. 27, Jesus tells us that the Scriptures all speak of him.

But rather than starting in Genesis, we will start here in Luke 24. On his resurrection day, Jesus appeared to these two disciples, Cleopas and another unnamed disciple, as they walked from Jerusalem to Emmaus. These two were, as many of Jesus’s disciples, downcast and confused. We thought he was the king. Now he’s dead. But there are some rumors that he’s alive. What in the world is going on?!

For most of the encounter, these two discipled didn’t recognize Jesus. As they explained their sorrow and confusion, Jesus rebuked them and then explained to them the Scriptures about himself. Hughes suggests that *If there is anything that would make a preacher swell with envy, this is it! This was exegetical Heaven! The root idea of “explained” is the word from which we derive the word hermeneutics, the science of Bible interpretation. The Word of God incarnate explained the written Word of God*. Might we swell with love for our Savior as we search for him in all the Scriptures!

### Questions

1. Why were these two disciples sad and confused?
2. What did Jesus think they should have already understood?
3. Where can we find Jesus in the Bible?
