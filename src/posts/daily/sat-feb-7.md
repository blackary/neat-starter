### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *Lord*.

### Reading

Psalm 4:1-8—I Lie Down and Sleep in Peace

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* David asks God to listen to and answer him.
* All who pray in Jesus’s name can do the same.
* In Jesus, we can find peace even if we have many problems.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What similarities are there in Psalms 3 and 4?
2. What does David teach us by his example in this Psalm?
3. Why can we sleep in peace, even if faced with many troubles?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.)

Psalm 4 has many similarities to Psalm 3. Enemies, distress, scoffing words, trust, and peaceful sleep are found in both. Though we don’t know the situation of Psalm 4, we see a similar faith and similar protection from the sovereign LORD. 

Calvin notes that *after David in the beginning of the psalm has prayed to God to help him, he immediately turns his discourse to his enemies, and depending on the promise of God, triumphs over them as a conqueror. He, therefore, teaches us by his example, that as often as we are weighed down by adversity, or involved in very great distress, we ought to meditate upon the promises of God, in which the hope of salvation is held forth to us, so that defending ourselves by this shield, we may break through all the temptations which assail us*.

God sets apart the godly, faithful one for Himself. Because of that, if we are in Christ, God has set us apart for himself. As Ash puts it, *Christ is this godly one by nature; David was this godly one by grace, as is each of Christ’s people today, set apart for devotion to God and for the privilege of heard prayer*.

I can sleep in peace because of my covenant LORD. So can you.
