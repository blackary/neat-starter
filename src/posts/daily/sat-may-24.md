* God spoke to Moses on the mountain.
* The people could hear God speak with Moses.
* The people could not come up the mountain.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How many times did Moses go up the mountain?
2. What did Moses tell God?
3. What did God tell Moses?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on Exodus by Michael Bentley.)	*Having obtained the people’s agreement to the covenant, Moses climbed back up the mountain for a second time and told the Lord of their response. The Lord knows the hearts of all people. He was aware that the Israelites really meant it when they said that they would obey him fully. But he also knew that, when problems arose in the future, they would turn aside from their resolve. Nevertheless, despite all this, the Lord accepted the words of the people. He then went on to tell Moses what was going to happen—\[I will speak to you in a dense cloud.]*

*Moses (who must by now have been very tired) came down the mountain once again and … set them apart for God’s use. … They were to concentrate on preparing themselves, and giving all their energies towards hearing the voice of God and obeying his instructions. The people did not need to \[and were not permitted to] go up the mountain because Moses was the one who was to be the mediator between God and his people.* 

Now we hear God’s word in preaching, through a better mediator—Jesus!
