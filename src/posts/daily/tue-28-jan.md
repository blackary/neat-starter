### Reading

Revelation 19—King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

### O﻿ptional Reading

Joshua 5:13-15

### Notes

When Joshua met an armed man outside of Jericho, he asked him whose side he was on. But Joshua asked the wrong question, because the man told him instead who he was—the commander of God’s army. That commander is also spoken about here in Rev. 19.

This commander is Faithful and True. He is the Word of God. He is King of kings and Lord of lords. He is, as we well know, Jesus, God the eternal son. As the Nicene creed states, *one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father; through him all things were made*.

This one Lord, Jesus Christ, is the victorious warrior. Though the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies rage against him and wage war, Jesus wins! Anyone who does not submit to him will be destroyed. The inhabitants of Canaan would find that out. The nations of the earth will find that out. Every individual who does not love and obey King Jesus will find that out.

But those who are his people, who are invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb, who overflow with praise and adoration, are blessed indeed.

### Questions

1. Who can defeat King Jesus?
2. What is the marriage feast of the Lamb?
3. How should we respond to Jesus’s kingship?
