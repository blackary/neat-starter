* God is in charge.
* Even if it seems no one is in charge.
* Jesus is king of kings.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why does it seem at times that God is not in charge?
2. How do we know that God is in charge?
3. Who is king of kings?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.  Today’s notes are from a commentary on Obadiah by Gordon Bridger)	

*Sometimes it looks as if no one is in charge when we read our daily newspapers, or watch the news on TV. … we might well ask where God is in those areas of the world where the persecution of Christians goes on without any sign of relief. It may well be that some will wonder whether God is in charge in a personal situation where for a time disaster and tragedy come thick and fast … the people of God were likely to be asking the same kind of questions. Where is God in all this? Who is really in charge?*

*The answer that Obadiah gives, particularly in three key verses in his prophecy (1, 15, 21), is that in spite of appearances, God is sovereign and very much in charge. …*

*The vision of Obadiah, then, focuses on the Sovereign LORD and what he has to say to us. When we face problems in our lives, we often focus on the problems rather than on the Lord himself—even when we are on our knees praying about them! Obadiah begins and ends his message with an emphasis on the sovereign rule of the covenant Lord (Yahweh). His final statement that the kingdom will be the LORD’s (21) probably means that ‘the Lord will rule over all’, for the Hebrew word that Obadiah uses means literally ‘kingship’.*
