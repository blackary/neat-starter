* Jesus brought forgiveness for all who believe in him.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why is it important to believe Jesus and Adam are real men?
2. What did Adam do for us?
3. What did Jesus do for us?

### Notes

Adam and Jesus are both true historical men. God has appointed first Adam, then Jesus, to be representatives. Adam represented all of us in his sin and failure. As the 1784 New England Primer states, *In Adam’s sin, we sinned all*. Adam represented all of mankind before God as your federal representative. The result is that you have a real guilt before God by being a child of Adam (by ordinary reproduction). You might not like that Adam represented us. But who are you to talk back to God?

You sinned in Adam’s first sin. And you sin on your own. The fact that you sin, personally, is evidence that you fell in Adam. And the result of that fall, in Adam, is that you deserve judgment, condemnation , and death. Even if you want to blame Adam, realize that you would not have done any better. Praise God, Someone did!

In Jesus Christ, God also appointed a federal representative. Jesus’ federal headship is like Adam’s, but a lot better! If Adam and Jesus are not real historical men, we have no hope for our sin and misery. In Adam you sinned and are guilty. But if you have been justified by faith in Jesus Christ, then His righteousness is yours also. He gives grace to many. All get sin; many get grace (v15)! Who gets it? Those who admit their sin, repent, and believe in Jesus get grace—those who admit they are dead in Adam and can only be alive in Jesus.
