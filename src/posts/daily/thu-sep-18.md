### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What is Romans about?
2. Where does the gospel begin?
3. How did the gospel define Paul? How does it define you?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

Romans is, according to one author, considered to be arguably the most influential book in Christian history, perhaps in the history of Western civilization. According to the MLJ Trust website, *the Welsh preacher Martyn Lloyd-Jones preached 366 sermons from this book to the congregation at Westminster Chapel in the heart of central London on Friday evenings between October 1955 to March 1968. This series was also his first sermon series to be printed following his retirement.*

 Calvin identifies *the main subject of the whole Epistle \[as] justification by faith*. This is the gospel. Might God be pleased to build us all up in our faith and perhaps exercise His powerful gospel for the saving of some.

The gospel began in the Old Testament Scriptures. Paul variously calls it God’s gospel (1:1), Christ’s gospel (1:16), and my gospel (2:16, 16:25), in many ways defining not only Paul’s ministry, but his life. (As it should ours.) He was a willing slave to Jesus and His gospel. He rejoiced in hearing of the faith in Jesus that the Roman church members had. This response of faith to the gospel changes people from sinners to saints. Has it changed you in that way? And even though these Romans were Christians—saints—Paul was eager to preach the gospel to them because Christians need the gospel too.
