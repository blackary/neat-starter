### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What was Jonah asked and what was his answer?
2. What might we be asked and what should our answer be?
3. What is key to being ready as opposed to being afraid?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

In Jonah 1, the sailors asked Jonah to tell them who was causing the storm and why. Jonah gave them an answer—*I’m a Hebrew. I worship the LORD, the God of the heavens, who made the sea and the dry land* (Jonah 1:9 CSB). Of course, as we considered before, Jonah’s profession was not at that moment matching his actions.

In our reading today, Peter encourages all Christians to be *ready at any time to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you* (v. 15). This exhortation comes in the context of Christians suffering evil yet being a blessing in response. Their natural tendency is to be afraid of these evil doers. Peter instead calls them to remember that Christ is their Lord and to live with such hope that others will ask why they have it. Then, when asked, to be ready to give an answer or make a defense. Bently suggests *it is likely that Peter was referring to those occasions when Christians are challenged by ordinary people to explain their belief in Christ as their Lord and Saviour*.

Are you living with Jesus as Lord, exalted in your heart? Are you ready to give an answer—whether in times of persecution or in times of ease? Is your profession matched by your actions?
