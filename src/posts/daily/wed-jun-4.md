### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What were we when Jesus laid down his life for us?
2. How can we know that we are Jesus’s friends?
3. What should we do since Jesus made us his friends?

### Notes

Job’s friends, though they started out well, turned out not to be such great friends. We are told that even friends not named in the book turned against him. But we desperately want true friends—friends that stick closer than a brother (see Prov 18:24).

What might a true friend do? And not do? They might not do many of the things that Job reported that his friends and companions and even family did in Job 19. Instead, a true friend might lay down his life for his friend. 

Jesus, in our reading today, tells us that the *greatest love is for one to lay down his life for his friends.* Then he calls his disciples—including us if we are his disciples—his friends. Jesus laid down his life for us—his friends.

Sometimes someone will literally die for a friend. Such sacrifice deeply moves us. But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners \[not his friends, not worthy of his love], Christ died for us (Romans 5:8 CSB). 

Jesus chose us to be his friends. Died for us, his friends. Made us, by his death and resurrection, into his friends when we were by nature his enemies. 

Since he laid down his life for us, he calls us to lay down our lives in love for one another.
