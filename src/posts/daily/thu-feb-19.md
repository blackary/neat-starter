### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What should you do when you are wrongly accused?
2. How did Jesus respond when wrongly accused?
3. What are we doing when we trust God in such cases?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

What do you do when you are wrongly accused? We read and hear of people convicted of crimes who are later found to have been wrongfully accused. In those cases, they are usually given money for their unjust accusations, but how can they be given back the years of life spent in prison? David has in some way been wrongfully accused by Cush, a Benjaminite. We know nothing more. But we know some of what to do from David’s words.

David tells us to trust the LORD our God. That is easier to say than to do. We likely have not been sent to prison for a wrong accusation. We likely have not been torn apart by a lion as David perhaps feared he might be. But we likely have been wrongly accused. 

In trusting God in such a situation, we ask God to work. God can make right what we can’t. We also look closely at our own life. Even if we make claims of innocence, are we willing to consider that we are not entirely innocent? Are we willing to let God discipline us in like measure that we ask God to punish those who accuse us falsely. 

Our Savior, the Lord Jesus, was accused falsely. Yet we are told (Isa 53:7, Mt 26:62-63; 27:12-14) that Jesus didn’t try to answer back. Instead, He entrusted Himself to God His father knowing God would judge justly (1 Pt 2:23). We can trust God, too, if we are falsely accused.
