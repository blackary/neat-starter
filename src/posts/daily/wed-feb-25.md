### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How does David respond to the LORD’s name in Psalm 8?
2. How does Paul say everyone will respond to Jesus’s name?
3. What is excellent about Jesus’s name?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

David begins and ends Psalm 8 with the declaration of the excellent name of the LORD—his Lord. Paul instructs the Philippians, and us, that Jesus has a super-exalted name.

Because Jesus emptied Himself and died an obedient death, God raised Him from the dead and raised Him up to the very highest place. Hughes notes that *Paul says literally, “Therefore God super-exalted him” (v. 9a). Christ received the highest exaltation. This is incomprehensible. It is in a class by itself*.

Ellsworth comments that *having completed the work of redemption on the cross and having risen from the dead, the Lord Jesus ascended to the Father in heaven (Acts 1:1–11), where he now reigns in exaltation. The Father has given him ‘the name which is above every name’ (v. 9).*

Hughes notes that this name *is God’s own name kyrios (Lord), which was used in the Greek Old Testament to represent Yahweh, the personal name of the God of Israel. … Giving Jesus the name “Lord” (Yahweh) is the ultimate of all honors because he says in Isaiah 42:8, “I am the LORD \[Yahweh]; that is my name.” It is no one else’s name. Yahweh is the name that trumps all other titles—the awesome covenant name of the God of Israel—“the name that is above every name.”* 

How excellent is the name of our Lord Jesus Christ!
