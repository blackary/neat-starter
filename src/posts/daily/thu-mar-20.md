### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *house*.

### Reading

1 Kings 8:1-21—The Glory of the Lord Filled the Temple.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Solomon built the temple as God had promised David.
* God’s glory filled the temple when it was finished.
* God’s temple was a house for God’s name.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why did David not build God’s house?
2. What was put in the temple?
3. What is God’s glory?

### Notes

As God had promised David, his son, Solomon, built the temple, God’s house—a house for God’s name. After the house was built and the furnishings that had been in the tabernacle were placed in the temple, God’s glory filled the temple in a cloud that completely filled the temple. Inrig  notes that *this cloud was so overwhelming that it forced the priests to retreat from the temple. There is an important truth here: It is God’s presence that makes a temple God’s temple. Without the presence of God, Solomon’s building was nothing but an empty shell.*

This cloud of God’s glory, like the cloud that led Israel through the wilderness and the cloud that filled the tabernacle, was a representation of God’s presence. The word literally means weighty, but is almost used figuratively in the Bible. So, someone being referenced as weighty in the Bible was being noted for their grandness—their glory.

The TWOT notes that *forty-five times this form of the root relates to a visible manifestation of God and whenever “the glory of God” is mentioned this usage must be taken account of. … These manifestations are directly related to God’s self-disclosure’ and his intent to dwell among men*.

What wonder that the God, who cannot be contained even in the highest heavens, desires to dwell among his people. Even when his glory is not visibly present, he is there with us!
