### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *way*.

### Reading

Psalm 1—Two Ways

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* The way of the righteous is blessed/happy.
* The way of the wicked leads to ruin.
* We can only be on the righteous way by being born again.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How is the way of the righteous described?
2. How is the way of the wicked described?
3. Who alone is completely righteous?

### Notes

Psalm 1 describes one who has God’s blessings in contrast with the one who faces God’s judgment. And this blessed one is said to love the Law of God rather than the ways of the wicked.
We would do well to recognize that the one who loves God’s law is one who has been, in New Testament terms, born again. Apart from salvation we hate God and His law. 

This blessed man is not a legalist, but rather one who, as Boice notes, *loves God and seeks Him in the Scripture, where He may be found*. Spurgeon says *he is one who knows that the Law of the Lord is the daily bread of the true believer*. 

The one who loves God through His word is brought into sharp contrast with the one who is anti-God. This one is not one who bears fruit, not one who is planted by God in a well-watered place, not one who knows the many blessings of God.

At times it seems that the ungodly have it all. They seem to have happy, fruitful lives. Yet as we see them the way God sees them, we should be less tempted and troubled by their way. The contrast couldn’t be greater. Though the ungodly may seem to have an attractive life, Calvin notes that *when the Lord has brought them low, he shall drive them hither and thither with the blast of his wrath*.

Which way are you pursuing?
