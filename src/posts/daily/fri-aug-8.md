Listen for the word *be*.

### Reading

1 Corinthians 16:13-14—Steadfast Living in Unsteady Times

* We need to be, spiritually, on our toes.
* We need to do everything we do in love.
* Jesus helps us do both of these.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How can we be, spiritually, on our toes?
2. Where do we get the strength to resist Satan?
3. Why is it sometimes hard to love God’s people?

### Notes

(See last page for authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on 1 Corinthians by Derek Prime) 

*SPIRITUALLY WE NEED TO BE ON OUR TOES. We have an active enemy who is always on the prowl. Therefore, we must be on our guard and watchful so that we do not give him any opportunity of gaining an advantage over us.* 

*THE VERB ‘BE STRONG’ (v. 13) means strong in the sense of holding fast to Christ and faith in him (2 Thes. 2:15; Heb. 4:14). We are to know what we believe, why we believe and, most of all, whom we have believed.* 

*ALL THE BUFFETINGS OF SATAN must be met with faith and with the exercise of faith comes strength—strength in the Lord and in the power of his might (Eph. 6:10). Our strength is not something inherent in our human nature but something we derive from the Lord.* 

*SPIRITUAL FITNESS requires watchfulness, firmness of faith, courage and the daily experience of the Lord Jesus’ strength and power in our lives.* 

*WE ARE TO DO ‘everything in love’ (vv. 14, 24).* 

*HAVING DEVOTED A WHOLE CHAPTER to this subject, Paul reminds us of love’s priority. Love is to characterize all that we do. We are not only to do things with love but in love: it is to be the atmosphere that we breathe and the context in which we work.* 

*OUR LOVE too must be for all God’s people, no matter how awkward or disappointing they may sometimes be. Love is always ‘the most excellent way’.*
