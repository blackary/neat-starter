### Reading

John 21—Faith Moving Forward

### Notes

<div><small><i>Today’s notes are from a commentary on John by Colin Kruse.</i></small></div>

*After sharing breakfast with all seven disciples, Jesus singled Peter out and asked him whether he loved him more than ‘these’.* 

*Jesus could have been asking whether Peter loved him (1) more than the other disciples who were present did; (2) more than he loved those other disciples; (3) more than the large catch of fish, the boats and fishing gear. … the first option is to be preferred, remembering that Peter had been the most forward in asserting his dedication to Jesus (13:37–38; cf. Matt. 26:33).* 

*In answer to Jesus’ question, Peter said, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you. Peter’s response was positive, but involved no bold claims like those he had made previously. He simply said that his Lord knew the truth about his love for him. In response to Peter’s affirmation of love for him, Jesus said, ‘Feed my lambs.’ His commission to Peter was to feed his ‘lambs’, meaning he was to provide spiritual nourishment for new believers.*

*The only differences \[in the second question and response] are that Jesus’ commission to Peter is to take care of his ‘sheep’ implying pastoral care of believers generally (cf. 10:1–27).*

*In \[the third question and response] response, Jesus said, ‘Feed my sheep.’ This time Peter was charged with the responsibility to feed my sheep, meaning he was to provide spiritual nourishment for believers generally.*

*Jesus may have given Peter three opportunities to re-express his love for him and recommissioned him three times as well because of his threefold denial.*

*Peter was to take up his cross literally and follow Jesus.*
