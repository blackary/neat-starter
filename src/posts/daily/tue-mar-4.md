### Questions

1. Who did people say Jesus is?

### Notes

When David desired to build God’s house, God said that instead, he would build David’s house and that David’s son would build God’s house. David’s son, Solomon, built the temple, but David’s greater son, Jesus would be the one who builds God’s spiritual house, his church.

Even today, people have all kinds of ideas about who Jesus is. When Jesus asked his disciples who people said he is, people tended to say that Jesus was a prophet of some kind. So, today, some say Jesus is a good teacher, some say he is a moral example to follow. But Jesus pressed his disciples, asking who they say that he is. And, Peter, who often said the wrong thing, got it right and said, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God. Only God himself can convince us who Jesus is.

Legg explains that, *now, under the new covenant, Jesus calls his Messianic community, the assembly of God’s people, ‘my church’. As King he will build his church; he will increase and strengthen his community. This community will embrace both Jews and Gentiles and its first stages will be built by Christ under the delegated authority of Peter and the other apostles*.

Jesus will build God’s house, his church.
