* Peter is writing to suffering Christians.
* Habakkuk is concerned with the wickedness of God’s people.
* God is concerned, too, and is doing an astonishing work.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What do we know about Habakkuk?
2. What is Habakkuk’s first complaint?
3. What is God’s astonishing answer?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

We know nothing of the prophet Habakkuk, as with many of the minor prophets, except from this writing. He writes near the end for Judah. His prophecy is a burden as he seeks to understand and wait on God. The prophet writes of a conversation he has with God about the wickedness of people and the sovereignty of God. Redmond, Curtis, and Fentress express with wonder that *Habakkuk had a vision of the Lord in which he (Habakkuk) was allowed to dialogue with the Lord about his struggles and perplexities*.

Habakkuk first complains about wickedness going on that God seems to ignore. We often think of complaining as sinful—and it often is. However, we are invited to make our complaints, respectfully and submissively, to God (see Ps 55:17, 142:2). 

God’s answer is that He will deal with the wickedness of the people—and it will be astonishing, even unbelievable! God will raise up Babylon (the Chaldeans) to bring his divine punishment against His people. What?! Yes, you read that right. God speaks—*Look, see, be utterly astounded!*

Currid notes that v. 5 literally reads: *‘Astound yourselves and be astounded!’ Repetition like this is emphatic. But why should the people of God be so dazzled and in wonder?*

Because God is working—but not the way they expect. Can you think of other ways in the Bible that God works astonishingly?
