### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What two cleanings does John tell of?
2. Why does God clean us if it hurts?
3. What happens to those who do not bear fruit?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

John the disciple and gospel writer tells of two occasions of Jesus cleansing His disciples. In the first, the amazing way Jesus showed His love to them was by washing their feet. This picture is of gentle, loving service, although feet that might be injured or sore would likely find even just soapy water somewhat painful.

In the second, Jesus speaks of His Father pruning or cleansing (the two words in Greek are nearly identical) fruitful branches so that they will bear more fruit. Pruning or cutting off of worthless shoots sounds a bit more painful. The cleansing of God’s people by God’s messenger that Malachi speaks of sounds more like this pruning/cleansing of the Father. It hurts at times. Bits that we have perhaps sinfully grown fond of are cut off. Yet painful as it might be at times, God’s cleansing work is always a work of grace.

Sproul notes that *Jesus said that those who do not bear fruit receive from God ario, which means “to be cut off,” and everyone who bears fruit receives kathario, which is translated here as “to prune.” There is ario and kathario, two words that sound alike. Kathario … means “a cleansing.” So Jesus said, “Those who are in Me and do not bear fruit are cut off; those who do bear fruit are cleansed, purified, nurtured, and pruned, so that they may become even more productive.”* Clean me, Father, that I may bear more fruit.
