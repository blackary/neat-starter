### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *learned*.

### Reading

2 Timothy 3:14-17—The Biblical Faith

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Timothy was taught from the Bible as a child.
* The Bible taught him how to be saved.
* The Bible, God’s own word, is useful to make us complete.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. From whom did Timothy learn the Bible?
2. What did Timothy learn from the Bible? What can we?
3. How did God give us the Bible?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on 2 Timothy by Michael Bentley)	*Timothy was only a comparatively young man, but Paul wrote to him encouraging him to live his life pressing on. He urges him to move forward in his Christian life and his pastoral responsibilities, saying, ‘Continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of’ (3:14).*

*There was much to discourage Timothy. All around him were evil men. They lived only for what they could get out of life for themselves, and they were also bent on leading others astray from the paths of godliness….*

*But Timothy not only learned from Paul; before that he had been taught by his mother and his grandmother. These two ladies are highly commended by Paul. In 1:5 Paul had written about the sincere faith which lived in Lois and Eunice. …*

*Because it is the very Word of God, the Bible is of great usefulness to God’s people. It is vital that the Word of God should form the basis of all of our teaching. Every doctrine which we hold must come directly from the Bible. Everything that we know about God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit comes straight out of the pages of this sacred book.*
