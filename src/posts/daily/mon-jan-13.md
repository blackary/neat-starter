### Reading

John 4:19-26 – Spirit and Truth Worshippers

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

Jesus came as Messiah. This Samaritan woman looked forward to Messiah coming to explain everything. In the immediate context of her conversation with Jesus, the question was how to worship. Some think this woman’s shift in the conversation away from her marriage difficulties to worship was simply an attempt to change the subject. However, Hendriksen suggests that *she was concerned about what God desired from her, and the answer was worship*.

This woman was concerned about worship. Jesus is concerned about worship. God is concerned about worship. In fact, Jesus tells us that God is seeking right worshippers! So, as children of God who have been saved by Jesus Christ, we should be concerned about worship. We should be striving to be those whom God is seeking—those who worship the Father in Spirit and in truth.

Like in Deuteronomy 12, we ought not worship God like the nations worship their false gods (Deut 12:4). Nor should we worship God in whatever way seems right in our own sight (12:8). Instead, we are to worship God consistent with how he has truly revealed himself. At the same time, guided by the Holy Spirit, we fully engage our own spirit toward God in this true worship. 

Are you worshipping as one whom God is seeking?

### Questions
