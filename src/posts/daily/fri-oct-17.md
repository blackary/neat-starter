### Reading

Amos 4:6-11—You did not return to me

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* God brought many judgments against Israel.
* He withheld food, rain, harvest, health, and even life.
* Yet they would not return to God.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What did God bring as judgments against Israel?
2. Why do you think Israel would not return to God?
3. In what ways are you tempted to stray from God?

### Notes

(See last day for authors.)	

Five times in these verses Amos brings God’s declaration to Israel—You did not return to me. God points out through the prophet that his disciplines acted against Israel were to be restorative—to bring them back. God withheld food. He withheld rain. He withheld harvest. He withheld health, even life. Yet they would not return.

Often hardships and difficulties will cause professing Christians to either move closer to God in dependence and prayer or move further from God in anger and rejection. Even if we don’t know the cause, even if we don’t believe this is a direct discipline from God, difficulties should always drive us to God. For those who love God, those who are called according to his purpose, no difficulties can separate us from God’s love in Jesus (Romans 8:28-39). How do you react to difficulties?

Jesus invites all who are weary, who are burdened, to come to him. He longed to see Jerusalem let him gather their children as a hen would gather her chicks, but they were not willing (Matthew 37-39). Since Israel was not willing to return in Amos’s day and since Israel was not willing in Jesus’ day, judgment would come!

Come to Jesus. Come and find rest. Give up the burdens you carry and find rest in him.
