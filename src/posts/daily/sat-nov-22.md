### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *cut off*.

### Reading

Micah 5:10-15—False Hope Removed

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* God will cut off from his people all that hinders our obedience.
* God will preserve his people.
* God will destroy his enemies.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What would God remove from His people?
2. Why is it right for God to act in anger and wrath?
3. How can we be saved from God’s just wrath?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.)	

Micah now tells the people God’s declaration of what He will remove from them. The language of removing and destroying is of removing and destroying what hinders God’s people from serving Him—and His King, Jesus—from the heart.

Smith comments that *all the political and religious props upon which ancient Judah leaned for support would be removed in the age of Messiah*. Yet we know ourselves how easy it is even now to put false hope in God’s blessings. Or to put hope in false gods. Otherwise, John would not have to write, *Little children, guard yourselves from idols* (1 John 5:1).

When God removes these things—even if it seems painful—it is for the good of His people. It is to bring us back to saving trust in Him alone. He disciplines His people as a father disciplines the child he loves. Do not despise the Lord’s discipline.

Our God is a God of vengeance. Obey Him or be destroyed. Of course, none of us can obey God sufficiently. That is why His promised Shepherd-King, Jesus, came. By trusting in His perfect obedience, we can (and we must) be saved from God’s righteous anger and wrath.

### Praise

Psalm 37a, 88a

### Prayer

1. Give thanks that the Lord will prune you but not destroy you.
2. Pray for the reading and preaching of God’s word tomorrow.
3. Pray for a member of our church, for your family, and for a non-Christian friend/family member.
