### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *king* and *Jerusalem*.

### Reading

2 Chronicles 36:1-14—The last of the kings of Judah.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Josiah’s sons were wicked.
* Josiah’s grandsons were wicked.
* They rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar and against God.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What did Josiah’s sons and grandsons do wickedly?
2. What did Nebuchadnezzar do against them?
3. What did the people do in imitation of Zedekiah?

### Notes

Josiah was the last of the good kings of Israel. He led the people in obedient life and worship and covenant renewal. It seems, though, that he neglected his own house. As the nation of Judah draws to a close, we meet two of Josiah’s sons – both, sadly, did evil in God’s sight.

The people of Judah chose Jehoahaz to be king upon Josiah’s death rather than his older brother (see 1 Chron 3:15). His reign was only 3 months before Egypt’s king seized him and put him in exile in Egypt. Kings tells us that Jehoahaz did what was evil in the Lord’s sight (2 Ki 23:31). Then Egypt’s king established Jehoahaz’s brother Jehoiakim as king. Smith notes that *Jehoiakim was the villain of the closing years of Judah’s history. He was everything that is despicable in a national leader. Nebuchadnezzar takes evil Jehoia-kim captive to Babylon. Judah is falling*.

The unravelling continues with another set of brothers—sons of Jehoiakim. The firstborn, Jehoiachin, reigned just over 3 months, doing evil. After a siege by Nebuchadnezzar, Jehoiachin surrenders, is taken to Babylon, and his brother is made king. Zedekiah rebelled against God, doing evil, and also against Nebuchadnezzar. The Chronicler makes it clear that Zedekiah’s rebellion against God was the most severe. Hard-hearted and stiff-necked, not only did Zedekiah sin against the Lord, he led the nation to multiply their unfaithful deeds. What a disgrace when those named as God’s people delight in their sin rather than God.
