### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *LORD* and *feared*.

### Reading

Malachi 3:13 – 18—A Book of Remembrance Was Written

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* We should all talk about God.
* But our words must reflect a respect for God.
* God keeps track of those who fear him.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What was this first group saying against God?
2. What was the second group speaking about God?
3. When does God hear and remember what we say?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

In our final section of this chapter, we have a book of remembrance written—two actually. One is the book of Malachi’s prophecy in which he notes God’s people complaining about serving Him. Smith notes that *the people were negative in their attitude toward serving God. …They thought that serving God demanded too much and returned too little!* We can be that way, too. We can say, *as long as I get back from God what I want, I will serve Him*. But we must serve the Lord because He is worthy, not because it gains us temporary benefits. To be sure, God often gives us temporary benefits beyond even what we ask for or think we might get. But let us serve Him because He is God.

Secondly, another book is written. The God-fearing people (probably not the same ones who complained about serving him) talked together. Benton suggests a scenario like this, *One person said to himself, ‘Now that person there seems to fear God. I’m going to invite him round and we are going to talk together, not about the cost of living, nor the first division championship, nor the weather, but we are going to share together about our mutual fear and regard for God.’*

We shouldn’t think that God only listens sometimes—he hears everything and knows our words even before we speak them. But God listening here seems to be connected to this book of remembrance written about those who feared the Lord and talked together about Him.
