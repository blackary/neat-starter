### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *Lord*, *God*, and *forever*.

### Reading

2 Samuel 7:18–28—Who am I?

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* David was amazed at God’s promise of an eternal king born from his line.
* David praised God’s greatness.
* God’s covenant promise is You will be my people; I will be your God.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Who is David to have such promises from God?
2. What is God’s covenant promise to his people?
3. Who are you to have such promises from God?

### Notes

What do you do when someone says something really special about you and to you? Maybe you get a little bit embarrassed because you think, *Who am I to have such wonderful things said to me?* That is what David said in response to God’s promise of an eternal king from David’s descendants. He did this as he sat in the Lord’s presence—interestingly the one time we find the seated posture in prayer in the Bible.

On the other hand, if you are proud, you might think, or say, *I deserve that*! Don’t! David doesn’t. He realizes that, in a true sense, he’s nobody—just a man seeking after God. God is the one who is great. 

Further, David knows that God is the God of his people. Over and over in the Bible we hear these words, *You are my people; I am your God*. What a wonder that is! We are God’s people. God is our God. God is my God! Having then been blessed by God, David closes his prayer asking that God will do just what he has promised to do—bless the house of his servant. And the result of that blessing is that God’s servant’s house continues before the Lord.
