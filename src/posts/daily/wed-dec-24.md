### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What can we think about to combat being anxious?
2. How can we find strength for contentment?
3. What will God, in Jesus, give us?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

Again, Paul urges the Philippians to rejoice in the Lord. In this rejoicing they are to let their reasonableness be evident. And in this reasonableness and rejoicing they are to dispel anxiety/worry. In nothing is the Christian to worry or be anxious. Nothing. As Ellsworth notes, *Christians are not to be filled with anxiety and tossed with care. They are rather to bring their problems and needs to the Lord with the confidence that he cares for them and his care is sufficient*.

Because the believer knows that the Lord cares for them, they can rejoice—always. God’s care provides everything the believer needs. Sometimes it will be little. Sometimes it will be plenty. Yet Paul had learned, like Habakkuk, to be satisfied with God whatever the circumstances. Although v.13 is often taken out of context, its primary lesson is that every Christian, like Paul, can be content, no matter what the circumstances—because Christ gives them strength to do so! And so, like Habakkuk knew and like Paul knew, so we can know that because of Jesus, and in Him, we can rejoice and we will have strength for whatever He gives us.
