### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

All today’s notes are from Derek Thomas	

*This is a chapter which features the work of God’s Spirit. The word ‘spirit’, in both Hebrew and Greek, is a picture word. It pictures breath breathed, or panted out, as when you blow out candles on a birthday cake or puff and blow as you run… When ‘Spirit’ is used of the Holy Spirit, it is meant to convey the powerful effect of his work.*

*Here, in Ezekiel 37, the word ‘spirit’ refers to breath, wind and the Holy Spirit in quick succession. It is meant to signal (as it evidently did to Hebrew readers) that the work of the Holy Spirit is both powerful and visible.
Not since chapter 11 have we been told that Ezekiel was taken somewhere by the ‘hand of the Lord’ (37:1). The prophet is taken to a ‘valley’ to observe a gruesome sight: the unburied, skeletal remains of a fallen army. It is a depiction of Jerusalem after its fall to the Babylonians, and it comes at what must have been one of the lowest points in the recorded history of Israel. At such a point, God comes with a word of great encouragement to cheer the hearts of his despondent people. It is a vision in which the bones come to life by the intervention of his sovereign power. When things are at their lowest ebb, God intervenes with promises of hope, blessing and revival.*
