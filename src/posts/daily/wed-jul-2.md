### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *take.*

### Reading

Mark 14:22–25—Take.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus gives his body and blood to us spiritually.
* We take it from him.
* Our taking is an act of faith.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What did Jesus say as he gave the bread?
2. What did Jesus say as he gave the cup?
3. Did the disciples take the bread and cup? How do we know?

### Notes

Today’s notes are taken from the Young People's manual of RPCNA to help us prepare for the Lord’s Supper

*Remember, we are considering the six significant acts to be understood as we come to the table of the Lord. The first act was that Jesus took bread. The second significant act was that he blessed the bread. The third act was that Jesus broke the bread. The fourth significant act is the giving of the elements to the communicants.*

*There are two more significant acts, but they are acts on the part of the communicants. The disciples reached out their hands to receive the bread and the wine.  When the Lord Jesus said, "Take," they obeyed.  They believed that Christ could give them everlasting life.  Their act, therefore signified how faith works.*

*Faith extends its arm to lay hold of what the Father offers us in the person of his crucified Son.  When the hand goes out, the soul ought to say, "I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord." (Ps. 116:13).  It ought to say, "You, O Christ, I now accept, on your own terms, as my personal Savior and my only hope of obtaining life eternal."  Thus, in back of this act, and pervading it, is the doctrine of justification by faith.*
