### Reading

Hebrews 12:18–29 – Worship God Acceptably

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

If you want to get someone a gift, how can you be sure they will like it? Sometimes silly husbands decide that whatever they like will certainly be what their wife will like, so the latest cordless toy tool gets wrapped in gift paper for their beloved. And often, that is not what their wife wanted.

How can you be sure your gift is acceptable? Ask what they want. How can you be sure your worship to God (something far more important!) is acceptable? Ask God what he wants. God directs us by his word in how we are to worship him acceptably. God enables us, in Jesus, to worship him acceptably. We have not come to the mountain of terror; Instead, we have come to the mountain of grace. Because we have come to Jesus, we are able to worship God acceptably. 

Phillips reminds us that *while the gospel gives us a better revelation than that received at Mount Sinai, a salvation through God’s grace in Jesus Christ, it is not a different God who speaks in this age. God is unchanging. He is now as he always has been, and that means that he is still holy and exalted, awesome in his glory. He is still “a consuming fire.” The gospel invites us to draw near to God, to live upon his mountain in the city he has prepared.*

So, come in that gospel grace and worship God acceptably.
