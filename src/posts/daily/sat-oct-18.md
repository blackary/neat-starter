### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What did God say that he will do to Israel?
2. How is God described in these verses?
3. Are you prepared to meet God? Explain.

### Notes

(See below for all authors)	

Having invited his people again and again to repent and return, now Amos brings God’s warning of judgment. Prepare to meet your God! Keddie notes that *‘Prepare to meet your God’ is a slogan beloved of cartoonists with a penchant for ridiculing the Christian message, but there are few more solemn words. Men who laugh at God must be terribly sure that they will never meet him, though on what basis they should be so confident is a mystery. Israel must meet him. All men must meet him*.

To meet God is either an event of supreme joy or of unspeakable terror. Are you prepared? Keddie further asks, *when the books are opened and the full story told, will you be found to have come to Christ, resting entirely on his full atonement for sin and pleading his mercy and merits for your salvation? Or will you go blithely on, careless of your soul and your eternal destiny, perhaps trusting in the rags of your own self-invented righteousness to pull you through somehow? Time is short! Now is the day of salvation!*

What wonder that we can indeed be prepared, only by faith in Jesus Christ, to meet the God of hosts and hear him say, Welcome.
