### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *son* and *children* and *weeds*.

### Reading

Matt 13: 36-43—Jesus Interprets His Parable

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* The farmer is Jesus.
* The good seeds are Christians.
* The weeds are non-Christians.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why did Jesus speak in parables?
2. What is the field in this parable?
3. What will happen to unbelievers at the end?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on Matthew by Daniel M. Doriani)	*Jesus moved on, but the disciples did not understand, so they “came to him and said, ‘Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field’ ” (13:36). Jesus says the elements in the story represent characters in real life. The story is an allegory and it has three phases. First, the farmer sows good seed, seed that will grow. Second, an enemy sows weeds in the field where the seed grows. The weeds threaten the crop. Yet, third, the wheat survives. In time the harvest comes; then the farmer destroys the evil weeds and gathers the wheat to himself. He saves the wheat, which is good news, for the wheat represents the children of God.*

*Jesus said, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man” (13:37). That is, Jesus is the sower. He sows continually, not just once. He sows good seed—the gospel. The message comes as a story, not an ultimatum, for the kingdom does not come by force, or like an army.*

*Jesus also explains that “the field is the world” (13:38). … he says “the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom” whereas “the weeds are the sons of the evil one” (13:38b). So Jesus scatters us through the world. In one sense, we take his truth with us, wherever we go. In another sense, we are his truth. Whenever our lives show the sweet strength of Jesus, we are his seed.*
