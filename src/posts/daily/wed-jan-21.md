### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How is Jesus the Word?
2. When did Jesus begin?
3. What does John reveal in these verses that Jesus has done?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

Malachi promises that God’s Messenger of the Covenant will come. But after Malachi’s prophecy, there were 400 years of silence from God. Then came John the Baptist, a messenger preparing the way for Jesus. More significantly, then came the Word from God.

John introduces Jesus as “the Word.” Hendriksen notes that *a word serves two distinct purposes: a. it gives expression to the inner thought, the soul of the man, doing this even though no one else is present to hear what is said or to read what is thought; and b. it reveals this thought (hence, the soul of the speaker) to others. Christ is the Word of God in both respects: he expresses or reflects the mind of God; also, he reveals God to man.*

Jesus—the eternally existent God the Son—is the creator of the world. Jesus—the eternal light of the world—is the only way to escape the darkness and find true life. Jesus—the Message and the Messenger from God—reveals God to us so that we might receive Him and become God’s children.

Do you know this Jesus? Each time you read a bit more, study a bit more, understand a bit more, hear this Word a bit more, do you find yourself marveling a bit more and loving Him a bit more?
