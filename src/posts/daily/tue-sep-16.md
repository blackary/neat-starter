<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word persecutions.

### Reading

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* God delivered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
* God delivered Paul from his sufferings, too.
* God didn’t deliver them the exact same way.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How were Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego rescued?
2. How was Paul rescued?
3. Can we be sure God will always rescue us? Explain.

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego said Our God is able to deliver us. And, as we saw in Daniel 3, he did. Here in our text today, Paul speaks of being delivered by God from his persecutions and sufferings. Hughes tells of when *Timothy was in Lystra when Paul was stoned. Rocks crashed against Paul’s skull, and he fell blood-spattered and broken beneath the rubble. He was dead, they all thought, and his murderers departed, leaving his body to his followers. How the believers mourned. What would they do without him? Suddenly Paul popped one eye open, then the other. “It’s all right, brothers! No funeral today! Let’s get out of here!” And “he got up and went back into the city” (Acts 14:20).*

Paul was left for dead, beaten and bloodied. He lived—he was rescued—but we would prefer the deliverance Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego received! They didn’t even smell like smoke after being thrown into the fiery furnace.

God will deliver his people always—by completely removing the affliction, by helping us endure it, or by taking us to heaven. If we long to live a godly life in Jesus, it should not surprise us that we will face opposition from others—even persecution. But God, who rescued Jesus from the grave after he suffered the cruel death of the cross and the just judgment of God for all the sins he bore for all his people, will rescue us too.
