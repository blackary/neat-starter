* Solomon wrote most of the Book of Proverbs.
* The proverbs are full of wisdom for us to learn.
* Jesus is the wisdom of God.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What do the proverbs equip us with and for?
2. Where does knowledge begin?
3. What does it mean to fear the Lord?

### Notes

Proverbs—a book of short, sometimes unconnected, wisdom sayings. Newheiser comments that *Proverbs equips the reader with moral skill for holy living, and Proverbs imparts mental discernment… The wisdom offered by the book of Proverbs is skill for living. … Jesus is the one who exemplifies wisdom, as he lived on earth with perfect skill. It is through Christ that we are made wise and gain the ability to live wisely*. 

Where does knowledge begin? In the fear of the Lord. But what does that mean? The RSB notes that *this idea is the controlling principle of Proverbs, and is ancient Israel’s decisive contribution to the human quest for knowledge and understanding. The fear of the Lord is the only basis of true knowledge. This “fear” is not distrustful terror of God, but rather the reverent awe and worshipful response of faith to the God who reveals Himself as Creator, Savior, and Judge*.

To fear God is to know Him and submit to Him, believing that His ways are always best. To fear God is to lovingly know Him. To fear God is to know, full stop.

Do you want knowledge? Seek to grow in this reverent awe and worshipful response of faith to God. Do you not want or care so much about knowledge? God says you are a fool!

Oh, that we would receive wisdom from Jesus in these proverbs!
