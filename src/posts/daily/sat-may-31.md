### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *for you*.

### Reading

1 Corinthians 11:23-34—Jesus Gave the Elements to his Disciples.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus gives his body and blood in the Lord’s Supper..
* This shows him to be our Savior who satisfied God’s justice.
* Ask your parents what Communion means.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What are the four significant acts we have considered so far?
2. What does Jesus offer in the Lord’s Supper?
3. How did Jesus save his people from their sin?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are taken from the Young People's manual of RPCNA to help us prepare for the Lord’s Supper)	

*Remember, we are considering the six significant acts to be understood as we come to the table of the Lord. The first act was that Jesus took bread. The second significant act was that he blessed the bread. The third act was that Jesus broke the bread.*

*The fourth significant act is the giving of the elements to the communicants.  To every true disciple of his Jesus offers his crucified body.  He gave—not the bread merely not the wine merely—but the broken body and the wine that had been poured out.  Jesus presents himself to men not primarily as a great teacher or a great example, or as a great reformer—for in all such respects he could have been great without the necessity of dying on the cross.  Above all else, and underlying all else, and permeating all else, he presents himself as SAVIOR, as the person who has satisfied the justice of God in our stead—a work which he could not do without submitting himself to be crucified.  What he offers us therefore is this finished work.  Take, he says.  Salvation comes to us as a gift without money and without price (Isaiah. 55:1).  The fourth significant act accordingly affords us a mental picture of that precious doctrine which we call salvation by grace.*
