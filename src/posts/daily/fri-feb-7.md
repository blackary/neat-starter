### Reading

Judges 2:6-15—A Generation That Did Not Know the Lord

### Optional Reading

Ephesians 6:1-4

### Notes

What a leader Joshua was! Imperfect, to be sure, even as he pointed to the perfect New Testament Joshua (Jesus). But the Israelites followed the LORD as long as Joshua lived. And as long as the elders who had served with Joshua and had seen the LORD’s wonders. But Joshua died. And the elders died.

Then we read that another generation rose up who did not know the LORD or the works he had done for Israel (v10 CSB). Why didn’t they know? God had commanded his people to teach diligently his words and his ways to their children (see Deut 6:6-9). It is, as Webb urges, the challenge for each generation—to make sure, as best they can, that what is foundational to their faith is not forgotten by those who come after them.

To be sure, many faithful parents have unfaithful children even though they have been faithfully trained. God’s own children, Israel, were often unfaithful. And praying God’s covenant promise to be God to us and to our children is never too late as long as our children live!

But this new generation of Israelites did not know or follow the Lord. As was too often the description of God’s visible people, *they always turned from Him; and following their evil plan, sank deeper yet in sin*. (Psalm 106F Book of Psalms for Worship). *God, we pray, O turn us, bring us back; Shine Your face on us, we’ll be saved!* (Psalm 80 BOPFW).

### Questions

1. How did Israel live during Joshua’s and the elders’ lifetimes?
2. How did Israel live after these men died?
3. How can we, with the Lord’s help, train the next generation to follow after him?
