### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *bread* and *cup*.

### Reading

1 Corinthians 11:23–29

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus has appointed that bread and the cup be used for communion.
* These are given and received by those who take part.
* They are taken for spiritual nourishment.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What are the elements of communion?
2. How are these elements to be taken?
3. In what way is Christ’s body and blood present at communion?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. In preparation for communion we are reading through a modern English revision of the Westminster Larger Catechism on the Lord’s Supper)	

*Q169. How has Christ appointed that the bread and wine be given and received in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper?*

*A.	Christ appointed the ministers of his word, when administering the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, to set apart the bread and wine from common use by the word of institution, thanksgiving and prayer. They then take and break the bread, and give both the bread and the wine to the communicants. In accordance with Christ’s appointment the communicants are to take and eat the bread, and to drink the wine, in thankful remembrance that the body of Christ was broken and given, and his blood shed, for them.*

*Q170. How do those who receive rightly the Lord’s Supper feed on the body and blood of Christ?*

*A.	The body and blood of Christ are not physically present in, with or under the bread and wine in the Lord’s Supper, and yet are spiritually present to the faith of the receiver in a way no less true and real than the elements are to their outward senses. It follows that those who rightly participate in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper do not feed on the body and blood of Christ by the mouth in a physical manner, but in a spiritual yet true and real way when by faith they receive and apply to themselves Christ crucified and all the benefits of his death.)*
