### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *prophets* and *angels*.

### Reading

1 Peter 1:6-9—Prophets Searching and Angels Longing

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* OT prophets studied hard to know of salvation in Jesus.
* Present day preachers preach this good news of Jesus.
* Even the angels long to glimpse the wonder of salvation.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What did the OT prophets know of Jesus? Give examples.
2. What are faithful preachers announcing?
3. Why did the angels want to see about God’s unfolding plan?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on 1 Peter by William VanDoodewaard)	

*\[Peter] wants us to keep in view the outcome and completion of our salvation at the second coming of our glorious King of kings and Lord of lords. The grandeur, glory and beauty of this salvation is immense. In verse 10, Peter highlights for us the prophets’ desire to more fully understand this gracious work. These inspired men … were eager to know as fully, precisely, and clearly as possible just how God would accomplish the redemption of his people. …*

*The prophets knew that a final, once-for-all sacrifice would be made (Hebrews 10:1–10). They knew that their sin needed blood atonement; they knew that God himself would provide. They knew that the Christ would be a suffering servant, one who would also bring God’s people into new life, eternal fellowship with God, and great glory. Christ made this known to them, by his Spirit.*

*The interest in the great salvation of sinners is not limited to man. These are ‘things into which angels long to look’ (1:12). There is a cosmic interest in Christ’s saving work. Redeemed men and holy angels, the “ministering spirits, sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation” (Hebrews 1:14), are gripped with interest in God’s unfolding plan. The innumerable crowd of saints and angels serves Christ, working and watching for the coming marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:6–9). Earth itself has anticipation (Romans 8:19–22).*
