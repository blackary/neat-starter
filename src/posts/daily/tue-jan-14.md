### Reading

Matthew 4:1-11 – Worship God only

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

Leaving aside the question of whether God ever leads us into temptation, Jesus was led into the wilderness, by God’s Spirit, in order to be tempted by the devil. We already know the outcome—Jesus defeated three clear temptations from the devil. In a sense each of these temptations was about worship.

Jesus was hungry. He had the power to turn stones into bread. Eating bread was not sinful in and of itself. But it wasn’t the most important thing. Could Jesus depend on his Father to supply him with what he really needed—letting God’s word sustain his soul such that his very hungry stomach could wait to be satisfied.

The 2nd temptation deals with trusting God falsely. Will we use God to respond to our whims. Will we worship so that God owes us something in return? Again, Jesus lived by God’s word and not the words of the tempter.

Finally, the devil puts it all on the line—*Worship me, Jesus, and I’ll give you all the kingdoms of the world*. Jesus was, we are told, tempted as we are, yet without sin. So, this offer, with all of its problems (the kingdoms of this world are not Satan’s to give), was to Jesus a genuine temptation. *You can have the crown without the cross, Jesus. Just worship me, the devil.* Again, Jesus is devoted to God’s word and God’s ways and will worship God only. And, in Jesus, so must we.

### Questions

1. What would have been wrong with Jesus making bread from stones?
2. What would have been wrong with Jesus jumping off the temple?
3. What would have been wrong with Jesus worshipping Satan?
