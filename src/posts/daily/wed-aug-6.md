### Optional Reading 

Genesis 28:10-22

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Philip brought Nathanael to Jesus
* Nathanael realized who Jesus is
* Jesus is the ladder in Jacob's dream 

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Did Nathanael believe Philip about Jesus?
2. What did Jesus say to Nathanael that changed his mind?
3. Who did Jesus say the ladder in Jacob's dream is?

### Notes

After Jesus showed incredible insight into Nathanael, Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!" Yet that was only a small taste, because Jesus told him he would see even greater things. From there, Jesus referenced the story of Jacob's ladder in Genesis 28. But there is something interesting in this statement. Instead of saying we will see angels ascending and descending on a ladder, He said that we will see angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man! Without a doubt, Jesus is saying that He is the ladder in Jacob's dream! 

John Calvin says this about Jesus' words: "*that though the whole human race was banished from the kingdom of God, the gate of heaven is now opened to us, so that we are fellow-citizens of the saints, and companions of the angels, (Ephesians 2:19;) and that they, having been appointed to be guardians of our salvation, descend from the blessed rest of the heavenly glory to relieve our distresses.*" Whether we are struggling with our sin, feeling abandoned in our suffering, or wrestling with unbelief, cling to this reality! The gates of heaven are opened to us now through Christ, and his goodness and mercy will follow us all the days of our lives, until He brings us home.
