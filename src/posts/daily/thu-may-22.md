* Job wanted to question God.
* Instead, God questioned Job.
* Job could only listen, then repent.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What might be right ways to question God?
2. How did God question Job?
3. How did Job answer?

### Notes

Job finally gets his wish (13:22, 31:35). The LORD will answer him. Out of the whirlwind God speaks to Job—out of His word God speaks to us. As Thomas notes, *Job’s wish has come to pass: we must be careful what we ask for, because sometimes we get it*.

Job had planned to engage in dialog with God, presenting an orderly case expecting to hold God accountable. Instead, God prepares Job—rebuking him for questioning (darkening) God’s ways and calling him to “man-up.” And then, God begins His questions—question after question after question after question after question (37 in the CSB in just chapter 38). God begins asking *Who? Who is asking questions of me? Instead, I will ask questions of you.*

Some of God’s questions are as follows. Where were you when I created the world? Where were you when I placed the boundaries on the sea and the whole of my created order? Have you commanded the morning? (Some of you might try to by sleeping until afternoon, but that’s not what God meant.) Can you control the stars? (v31ff) Can you control the great leviathan? (chap. 41) Do you know when and how the wild animals give birth? chap. 39) And, most blatant: Would you overrule my judgement? Would you really hold the Almighty God to account!? (40:8)

Job didn't answer any of God's questions. If he had, his answers would have been “no.” “no.” “no.” “no.” “no.” “no.” Yet, in this dialog, God revealed himself to Job, accepted Job (42:8-9). And God blessed Job (41:12ff)
