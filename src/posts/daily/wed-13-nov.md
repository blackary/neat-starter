### Reading

Luke 23:55-24:12 He is not here, but he has risen!

### Notes

Again, remember that even though we read the historical account of Jesus rising from the dead in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Jesus himself tells us that it is written in the Old Testament Scriptures that this would happen (see Luke 24:46).

We are likely familiar with this historical account. Yet we should always be amazed when we read about it. This is a miracle of the highest order—a man murdered unjustly by the Romans at the request of the Jewish leaders and buried in a tomb, who then is no longer in the tomb when his followers checked on the third day. Instead, two angels testify that “he is not here, but he has risen!”

As Hughes notes, *as we consider the state of the Galilean women, we must not let our knowledge of the glorious revelation that awaited them dull us to the dark sackcloth covering these women’s souls. They were depressed, exhausted, mourning, with no hope whatsoever—and according to Mark, fretting over how they would get into the tomb (16:3). They did not expect anything except more sorrow. If you take flowers to the cemetery, do you expect to see an empty grave? And if you did see one, would it occur to you that the deceased had risen from the dead? Of course not!*

Let us be amazed with these women. Though they did not yet fully understand, they immediately told the apostles about these things. Let us, too, proclaim, He is risen indeed!

### Questions

1. What did the women expect to find at the tomb?
2. What did they find instead?
3. What difference does it make that Jesus is risen?
