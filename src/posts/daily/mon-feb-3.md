### Reading

John 20:24–29—Blessed are those who believe without seeing

### Notes

<div><small><i>Today’s notes are from a commentary on John by Kent Hughes.</i></small></div>

*Some say Thomas spoke for the whole world: “Give me proof and I’ll believe!” I am not so sure. I think the world’s view is more like, “Show me the facts, and I’ll invent another theory.” …* 

*Praise God, there was a remedy for Thomas, and there is a remedy for us. The Lord gave Thomas time to think about the situation, eight days to be exact, and Thomas did just that. He was fellowshipping with the apostolic band…* 

*Thomas may have been slow to believe, but he was not slow to grasp the implications of Christ’s resurrection. Jesus was not only his Lord but his God. The evidence was palpable, substantive, and clear. Thomas’s faith rested on solid rock.*

*What about us? The evidence is still just as substantive, just as palpable, just as clear. “Then Jesus told him, ‘Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed’ ” (v. 29). We can be part of that blessed company. It is not a ship of fools. We have the prophetic Scriptures to confirm our faith, not the least of which is Psalm 22. And we have the testimony of resurrected lives.*

*The Lord pronounced a final beatitude on those who do not see and yet believe. We have great joy now and will someday share in the likeness of his resurrection. In the words of Joni Eareckson Tada, “I know the meaning of that now. It’s the time after my death when I’ll be on my feet dancing.”*
