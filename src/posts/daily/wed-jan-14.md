### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How do we know that Zechariah’s promised king is Jesus?
2. What hymn was likely on the hearts and lips of the crowd?
3. What is the importance of Hosanna?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

Both Matthew’s and John’s gospels affirm for us that the promised coming King of whom Zechariah speaks was indeed King Jesus. To fulfill Zechariah’s prophecy, Jesus sent two disciples to find a donkey and colt, untie them, and bring them to Jesus.

As he rode into Jerusalem on this donkey’s colt, the crowds shouted joyful praises to King Jesus. `Hosanna to the Son of David!` Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Likely at this Passover time, the words of the Passover Hallel (Psalm 118, probably the hymn that Jesus and his disciples sang before going out to the Mount of Olives Matt 26:30) were fresh in their minds and were on their lips. *LORD, save us! LORD, please grant us success! He who comes in the name of the LORD is blessed. From the house of the LORD we bless you* (Psalm 118:25 – 26 CSB).

Shaw notes that *the shouting of the crowd implied that they recognized Jesus as the long-promised Messiah. The response of the Pharisees to the shouting of the crowd also indicates that the scribes and the Pharisees understood the messianic implications of the shout (see Matt. 21:15–16; Luke 19:39–40). Jesus’ rebuke of the Pharisees shows that not only did Jesus recognize the messianic interpretation, but that He affirmed it as applying to Himself*.

King Jesus, save! He has! Is He your saving King?
