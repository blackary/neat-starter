### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What do we desperately need God to remember in his wrath?
2. How did God show mercy to his people in exile?
3. What did God raise up Cyrus to do?

### Notes

The prophets acknowledge God’s just wrath against His people’s sin and rebellion. Yet, the plea of Habakkuk resonates throughout God’s dealings with His disobedient people: “In wrath, remember mercy” (Hab 3:2). Although the Chronicler does not mention that plea, it is clear his intent is to remind God’s post-exile people of that hope.

As Stewart notes, *These verses record the decree of King Cyrus in 538 B.C. that the Jews in exile were to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the city. It is not on a note of destruction, but of restoration, that the Chronicler ends his history. The working of God’s providence in history speaks of his sovereign mercy to undeserving men and women. Even a pagan ruler like Cyrus was an instrument in God’s hands and a shepherd for the flock of God (see Isa. 44:24–45:3).*

*This is also a Messianic note on which to end. The Lord’s anointed will be a mighty king who will deliver his people. Like the rest of the Old Testament, the Chronicler leaves us with the hope of a Saviour who will provide deliverance for his people. ‘But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under law that we might receive the full rights of sons’ (Gal. 4:4–6).*
