* Isaiah tells us Jesus didn’t speak to the accusations against Him.
* Matthew also tells us Jesus didn’t speak to them.
* We can shout praise because Jesus kept silent.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why didn’t Jesus speak to the accusations against Him?
2. When might it be best to remain silent when wrongly accused?
3. When might it be best to speak up?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

When David is trusting God while wrongly accused, he doesn’t defend himself. He does ask God to defend him. When Isaiah speaks prophetically about Jesus facing unjust accusations, he tells us that he did not open his mouth. When Matthew records Jesus at trial facing unjust accusations, he tells us that Jesus did not answer even one charge.

Sometimes the hardest thing to do in the face of unjust accusations is to say nothing. And we might do well to, in some circumstances, to imitate Jesus in saying nothing. But that is not commanded. There are times to answer unjust accusations to our unjust accuser.

But, I think, a more important take-away from Jesus’s silence is the reason for it and the result of it. As Calvin states it, *Christ was silent, while the priests were pressing upon him on every hand; and it was, in order that he might open our mouth by his silence*. Or similarly, in Odonnell’s words, *we should be amazed that Jesus kept quiet then so that we might shout “Hallelujah!” now. Yes, hallelujah that though Jesus “had a just defense to offer,” he was quiet at the judgment-seat of Pilate*.
