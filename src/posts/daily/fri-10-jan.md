### Reading

Deuteronomy 12:15-31 - Don’t add to or take away from

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

When John Calvin was asked to write a defense of the reformation, he penned a short book titled T*he Necessity for Reforming the Church*. Calvin listed two primary reasons the reformation was required: *first, of the mode in which God is duly worshipped; and, secondly of the source from which salvation is to be obtained*. It is certainly interesting that the second is what people more often associate with Calvinism.

However, Calvin was certain that the first was the primary reason for the reformation taking place. He says *I know how difficult it is to persuade the world that God disapproves of all modes of worship not expressly sanctioned by His Word. The opposite persuasion which cleaves to them, being seated, as it were, in their very bones and marrow, is, that whatever they do has in itself a sufficient sanction, provided it exhibits some kind of zeal for the honor of God. But since God not only regards as fruitless, but also plainly abominates, whatever we undertake from zeal to His worship, if at variance with His command, what do we gain by a contrary course?*

A contrary course would involve either adding to God’s worship commands or taking away from them (v. 32). So, when it comes to worshipping as God commands, no math is needed or allowed.

### Questions

1. What were Calvin’s two reasons for the reformation?
2. Why isn’t personal desire, with zeal, enough for our worship?
3. How does the Lord react to false worship?
