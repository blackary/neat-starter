### Reading

Luke 24:30-53 – Opened Eyes, Opened Minds

### Notes

These two disciples, like us, were foolish and slow to believe all of the Scriptures. They, like us, needed Jesus to open their eyes and their minds. And he did! And he does! When you come to the Bible, to read it privately, to read it with your family, you can (and should) always think or pray something like, *Open my eyes, Lord, that I will see wonderful things in your word*. 

Ryken notes that *Cleopas and his companion … still could not see Jesus. What makes this so deliciously ironic is that they were looking straight at him! The irony of their words at the end of verse 24 is intense. At the same time these disciples sadly lamented that their friends did not see Jesus, they themselves were looking him right in the face. Yet they did not see him either*. But, then, as he sat to eat with them and blessed and gave them the bread, their eyes were opened! They could see him. And then they couldn’t because he disappeared! But knowing they had seen him, they hurried back to Jerusalem to tell the other disciples. 

And then, as they were talking, suddenly they could see him again as Jesus appeared in the middle of them. And not only were their eyes opened (physically and spiritually), but Jesus also opened their minds as he explained the Old Testament Scriptures. Open my eyes, Lord. Open my mind, Lord. Let me see my Savior in all of the Bible!

### Questions

1. How can our eyes be opened to see Jesus?
2. How can our minds be opened to understand Scripture?
3. In what parts of the Bible should we see Jesus?
