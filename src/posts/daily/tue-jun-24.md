3. Do you believe that Jesus hears you when you ask?

### Notes

<div><small><i>Mon-Wed notes this week were written by Tyler H. in preparation for reviewing our visiting preacher.</i></small></div>

We learn that the Syro-Phoenician woman came to Jesus because she had heard of Him and the things that He had done (v.25). After finding Jesus, she asked for His help. But Jesus responded to her, saying it was not right to throw the children's food to the dogs.

However, Jesus' response was not meant to insult her, but to test her faith. She saw that it was a test, so she pressed into His response, saying that even the dogs can eat from the children's crumbs. The woman wasn’t proud or defiant, but she respected Him, calling Him Lord (v.28).

Schnabel writes, *the Syro-Phoenician woman is an example of persistent faith (mentioned by Matthew, implied by Mark). She responds to news about Jesus and his authority. She approaches Jesus, convinced that he has the power to free her daughter from demons. She perseveres with both boldness and humility in the face of an initial lack of positive response to her request. She has spiritual discernment in terms of what Jesus can and might do. She is 'willing to be last instead of first' (Strauss, p. 317). She trusts that Jesus has healed her daughter when he sends her home. She believes in Jesus as having unique, unprecedented authority*. 

In response to the woman’s faith, Jesus gives her what she asks for and heals her daughter. Let us also have the same faith to believe that Jesus is not only able, but willing to hear us when we pray.
