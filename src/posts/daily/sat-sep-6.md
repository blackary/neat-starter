### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *open* and *graves*.

### Reading

Ezekiel 37:11-14—I Will Put My Spirit In You

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* The dead bones were a symbol of Israel.
* God was going to bring Israel’s dead hope to life.
* God puts his Spirit on his people.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What is the basis for Israel’s hope?
2. What is the basis for our hope of effective service?
3. Why has God raised dead bones to life?

### Notes

(See below for all authors)	

All today’s notes are from Iain Duguid

*The oracle that follows the vision (37:11–14) merely serves to make explicit what the vision has already recounted. The dry bones are the whole house of Israel, who have come to recognize the seriousness of their situation. They are helpless and hopeless, cut off from God’s life-giving presence (37:11). Without in the least contradicting this self-perception that their present situation is hopeless—indeed, reinforcing the accurateness of the idea—the Lord still affirms that there is nonetheless hope for the future.*

*There is a sure and certain future based not on what Israel can do but on God’s determination to save his people. … The promises of a new spirit and a return to the land made in Ezekiel 36:27–36 will indeed be fulfilled. Then they will know that the Lord not only speaks but acts…* 

*When the resuscitated bones came together, they became an army, not a debating club or a beach party. They were raised for a purpose. In a similar way, we as Christians have been regenerated and Spirit-filled in order that we too may serve, equipped by the gifts of the Spirit and dressed in the armor of God so that we may do his bidding in the world.*
