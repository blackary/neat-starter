### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. From whom did Timothy learn the Bible?
2. What did Timothy learn from the Bible? What can we?
3. How did God give us the Bible?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on 2 Timothy by Kent Hughes)	*Now Paul urges Timothy to continue in the gospel… Timothy had become convinced of the gospel through the instruction of three people—his beloved mother Lois, his grandmother Eunice, and his closest friend, the Apostle Paul. Evidently though Timothy’s father was a Gentile (which accounts for Timothy’s not being circumcised), his Hebrew mother and grandmother had educated him in the Old Testament Scriptures. When Paul came preaching the gospel from the Old Testament, they believed in Christ and, with Paul’s aid, then instructed Timothy, so that he too believed.*

*Therefore Timothy had the enviable privilege of learning the gospel from both the lips and lives of these three people. Such a powerful combination! Earlier Paul had advised Timothy to “Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers” (1 Timothy 4:16). From the lips of his mother, grandmother, and Paul, Timothy heard the doctrine of the gospel message, and from their impeccable lives he saw it lived out. And that had a saving effect on him.*

*Think what it would mean if we could say to all our children … “You know your pastors, you know your Sunday school teachers, you know your fathers and mothers and grandparents. You know what they have taught you, and you know that their lives match the teaching of their lips. So continue in the gospel because you know from whom you learned it.”*
