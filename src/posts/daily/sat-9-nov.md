### Reading

Luke 24:1–12, 1 Cor 15:1–8 – Christ…According to the Scriptures

### Notes

The context for Jesus instructing the two Emmaus disciples and the rest of the disciples with the Eleven is, of course, the resurrection. In this glorious defeat of sin and death and the Evil One, Jesus fulfilled the promised Old Testament scriptures. So, we should expect to see Jesus in the Scriptures. Three books I have found helpful for seeing Jesus in the Old Testament are *Preaching Christ from the Old Testament* by Sidney Greidanus, *Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture* by Graeme Goldsworthy, and *Jesus on Every Page* by David Murray, Let’s hear briefly from each of them.

Greidanus calls us to *truly understand the message of the \[Old Testament] text as it fits in with the climax of God’s revelation in the person, work, and teaching of Jesus Christ so that we and other people may believe Him, trust Him, love Him, and obey Him*.

Goldsworthy reminds us that *Jesus says that the Old Testament is a book about him. … Luke records for us the extraordinary claim of the risen Christ that he is the subject of all the Scriptures (Luke 24:27, 44-45). … the overall structure of biblical revelation … finds its coherence only in the person and work of Christ*.

Murray states *we must be willing to put in the hours, the sweat, the toil, and the tears as we break up the long-untilled ground of the Old Testament. Above all, despite the prevalence of Christ-less moralism and the pressures of Christless academia, we must strive to find and enjoy Jesus in the Old Testament. That alone makes Old Testament study profitable and enjoyable*.
