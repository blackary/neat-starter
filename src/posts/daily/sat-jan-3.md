### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *sea*, *mountains*, *hills*.

### Reading

Psalm 114—When Israel Went Out

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* This Psalm speaks of God’s deliverance of His people.
* All of creation is subject to God’s power and providence.
* We, like Israel, can trust God for full and final deliverance.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. From where did God deliver His people?
2. How does this Psalm speak of creation reacting to God?
3. What can God do for His people?

### Notes

(See below for all authors.  Today’s notes are from a commentary on Psalms by Christpher Ash.)	

*When Jesus sang this psalm, he too celebrated the first and second exodus. But even as he did so, he sang of the greater exodus that he himself would accomplish by his sin-bearing death (cf. Luke 9:31). For the first and second exodus are types of this final exodus by which Jesus our Passover leads us out of our slavery to sin and into the new creation. …*

*We begin by joining the Lord Jesus in his life on earth as he meditates on the first exodus, from Egypt, and the second exodus, from Babylon. With him we rejoice that no power of evil, human or superhuman, could prevent God from redeeming his people. What was true then is true in every age of the frail and discouraged church. …*

*The terrifying waters at the start of the life of faith (the Red Sea powers of evil that seek to prevent anyone beginning the life of faith) and the frightening deeps at the end (the Jordan waters we cross at our deaths) may be faced because Christ triumphed over them in the cross in the past (Ps. 114:3) and because Christ continues to press home his victory in the present and future (114:5).*
