* God’s moral law reveals God’s character.
* God’s law is Christ’s law.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What are the ten words God spoke to Moses?
2. What does the moral law tell us about God?
3. What does the moral law tell us about ourselves?

### Notes

(Today’s Notes are from a commentary on Exodus by Philip Graham Ryken) *If the law comes from God, then the best place to begin understanding the law is with God himself. This is precisely where the book of Exodus begins its presentation of the Ten Commandments, also known as the Decalogue, meaning “ten words”: “And God spoke all these words” (Exod. 20:1). …*

*Is the law still binding today? This is a vital question. Do the Ten Commandments have any abiding relevance for Christians and the culture in which we live? Once we understand the relationship between our Lord and his law, this question is easy to answer: Yes, God’s law is still binding today! His standard has not changed, any more than his character has changed. …*

*What the New Testament never does, however, is to declare an end to God’s moral law as the standard for our lives. … This makes sense when we remember the close relationship between the moral law and the character of the Lord who gave it. The law is as eternal as God is. Furthermore, the character of God is also the character of his Son Jesus Christ. … The Son is every bit as sovereign, jealous, life-giving, faithful, truthful, and loving as the Father revealed himself to be in the Ten Commandments. … The law of Moses is not simply the law of God; it is also the law of Christ*
