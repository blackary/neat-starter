### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on Exodus by Philip Ryken)	*Exodus 3–4 recounts a lengthy discussion—not to say a dispute—between God and Moses. Moses was still trying to decide whether he wanted to lead God’s people out of Egypt or not; so he asked God five questions. First he wanted to know who he was to undertake such a difficult and dangerous mission: “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” (Exod. 3:11). God answered by saying that it didn’t matter all that much who Moses was, as long as God was with him. Second, Moses asked who God was (v. 13). If the success of his mission depended on God rather than on himself, Moses wanted to know what God’s name was. God answered by revealing himself as the Great I Am. …*

*We have come to know this same God through Jesus Christ, who is “the same yesterday and today and forever” (Heb. 13:8). …*

*The prophet had received his basic instructions. God had called him to go back to Egypt and tell Pharaoh to let God’s people go. Moses had also raised some questions: “Who am I? Who are you? How will they ever believe me?”*

*These were only the first three of what turned out to be five objections in all. As objections go, they were not altogether unreasonable, and in his patience God was willing to answer them. But the longer the conversation went on, the more obvious it became that Moses simply did not want to go.*
