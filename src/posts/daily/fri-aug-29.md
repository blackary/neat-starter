### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Did your plans this week happen? Discuss.
2. How do we know that God’s plans will always happen?
3. Do you think this promise is for us? Why or why not?

### Notes

(See last day for authors)	

Are all the promises of God in the Bible promises for us? If we think carefully about that, we will realize that no, they are not. God promised Abraham that his wife would have a child in about a year. Will my wife? I don’t think so. Will yours? God only knows.

In our text today we have a wonderful promise from God to the Babylonian exiles. God says, "I know the plans I have for you,” says the LORD. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. Before we consider if that promise is for us, let us look at the promise itself.

God has plans for his people. And he knows what those plans are. Nothing can make God’s plans change—not the false prophets, not the king of Babylon, no one. God makes plans and carries them out.

Secondly, God’s plans here are for his people’s good. They are not plans for their harm, or disaster, or evil. But we must remember that God alone knows what is good for his people. Parents know that fruits and vegetables are good for their kids. But kids sometimes think they are bad, or even gross!

Thirdly, God’s plans here are to give his people a future and a hope. They were exiles in Babylon! What kind of a future was that? Where was the hope in exile? Will we believe our circumstances? Or will we believe God?
Is this promise for us? Or just Judah in exile? Consider this, and we’ll see what Pastor Ed says in his sermon.
