* We must praise the Lord with our whole heart.
* We can do that because God is the just judge.
* Jesus is both savior and judge.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How can we know if God will deal with us as judge or as savior?
2. Why did David give thanks to God in this Psalm?
3. Who are we compared to God?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

In this Psalm, David rejoices that God is a just judge. He begins with a commitment that we all as Christians must have—wholehearted thanks. But how many of us can truly claim that we do give our whole heart to thanking God. Or loving God. Or praising God. Or obeying God. None of us, in ourselves, can make that claim. But as we are in Christ and as we become more and more so in practice, we can, must, and do—make that claim. 

We don’t know the circumstances of this Psalm. Some think it is a celebration of God’s victory, using David, against Goliath. But we can’t be sure. It is a celebration of God’s victory—of that we can be sure. God is the One whose wondrous works should be told. God is the One in and about whom we boast. God is the One about whose name we sing praise. 

David does that in this Psalm, and we do that, because God is a righteous judge. Jesus is the one by whom God will judge the world. But Jesus is also the one by whom God protects and saves His people. And we, as the Psalm ends, must know that we are only humans—mere men.

But that’s OK, as long as we are *only humans* devoted to and trusting in the God who saved us and who will bring about His just judgment.
