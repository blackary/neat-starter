<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Joshua, the high priest, is filthy, dirty, guilty.
* He knows it. Satan knows it. God knows it.
* We need a way to be cleansed from our guilt.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What do we know about Zechariah?
2. How does Zechariah describe Joahua the high priest?
3. What is Satan doing?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. )	

Zechariah is writing to the post-exile Jewish people. His name matches his prophecy. Bently explains that *Zechariah means ‘the Lord remembers’ and this is the theme of the eleventh of the twelve ‘minor’ prophets. God remembers his covenant and his holy laws, which he expects his people to obey. He will be satisfied with nothing less than whole-hearted obedience to his commands. Yet he also remembers his promises and always keeps his word never to forsake his chosen people.*

The book is made up of 8 visions in chapters 1-8, then 2 oracles in chapters 9-14. Our reading is the 4th vision. In this vision, Joshua the high priest is standing before the LORD with Satan accusing him. Why? Joshua is standing there in stained clothes—the word in Hebrew carries the meaning of dung. We need not think that Joshua has messed himself, but that he’s covered in filth. He says nothing. Satan has something to say. God has something to say but, Joshua just stands there in his filthy clothes. He’s guilty. No excuses. No justifications. Filthy. Dirty. Guilty.

Remember, this is Joshua the high priest. The high priest is—or at least should be—the best. He is the one people look up to and imitate, the one who leads the people in reverence for and obedience to God. You are guilty too. So am I. Filthy. Dirty. Guilty. Is there any hope to deal with our guilt? We’ll read on tomorrow.
