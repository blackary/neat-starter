### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Certain Chaldeans tattled on Shadrach, Meshach, & Abednego.
* These three men refused to worship this false god.
* They would rather be killed than dishonor God.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why did the Chaldeans tell on these three Jewish young men?
2. How did Nebuchadnezzar respond when told about them?
3. How did they express their love of, and trust in, God?

### Notes

(See last day for authors)	

Do you ever tattle on someone to get them in trouble? Maybe your brother or sister? Does someone ever tattle on you to get you in trouble? Well, certain Chaldeans tattled on Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to get them in trouble. Remember yesterday, when the music played, everyone fell down to worship the gold statue. Actually, now that we know more, it was everyone but these three Jewish young men who had been taken captive to Babylon. Their character had been noticed, and they had been given important positions in the Babylon government. 

They refused to worship anything or anyone but the living and true God. They would not compromise. Stortz suggests some rationalizing excuses they might have made but didn’t—important to save our lives; maybe it will give us a later opportunity to witness about the true God; God will forgive us; we’ll kneel on the outside, but inside we’ll stand and worship the true God. But they did not compromise. No false worship. None.

When confronted by Nebuchadnezzar, they state their confidence. *Our God can save us. And, even if he doesn’t, we will not worship your statue*. 

How willing are you to obey God? How much sacrifice are you willing to undergo to obey all of God’s ten commandments? How willing are you to take up your cross daily and follow Christ?
