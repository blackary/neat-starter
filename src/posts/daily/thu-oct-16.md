### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *cows*.

### Reading

Amos 4:1-5—You Cows of Bashan

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Amos rebuked Israel as “Cows of Bashan.”
* They cared more about themselves than neighbors or God.
* We may be tempted to do the same thing.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why did Amos call some in Israel “Cows of Bashan”?
2. What is the greatest commandment? And the second?
3. In what ways are you tempted to give God lip-service rather than heart-service?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

Dale Carnegie, in his book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, would not support Amos in his prophecy as our text begins. *Listen, you cows of Bashan*! But Amos was speaking from God to Israel and giving warning after warning of God’s coming judgment. Amos seems to be challenging the sleek, well-fed women behind the wicked leaders of Israel. They oppress the poor, they live in ease, and they worship with self-righteous lip service. 

Our Lord’s command to love him with all of our being and to love our neighbor as we love ourselves had become a lost commitment to these who claimed to be God’s people. Although Amos begins his prophecy announcing God’s judgment on the pagan nations (1:3-2:3) he turns to addressing Israel and Judah. Do we heed this text as a warning to us? Or simply regard it as God talking to other people—sinful people?

Jesus similarly rebuked the religious leaders of his day. Quoting Isaiah, he pointed out the hypocrisy between their actions and their heart (Matthew 15:7–9). But what about me? What about you? Do I sometimes care more for my own ease and comfort than that of my neighbor? Am I content to go through the motions of worship yet have a heart far from God?

Be on guard. Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
