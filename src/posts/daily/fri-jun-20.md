* We don’t know the name of this woman.
* Jesus was pleased with her great faith.
* Jesus cast the demon out of her daughter.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How did Jesus initially respond to the woman?
2. Why was Jesus the woman’s only hope?
3. What did Jesus do for the woman and her daughter?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on Mark by Kent Hughes.)	*The Scriptures record this delighted exclamation from the lips of Jesus: “Woman, you have great faith!” (Matthew 15:28), and that compliment warrants our closest attention. Thousands of named and unnamed people appear in Scripture. Only a few are commended for their faith. We find here in our text the faith of a woman whose name is unknown. …*

*In our passage, Jesus held the woman’s faith up first to the light of his strange silence, and then to his apparent rebuff, so the Church down through the ages could see how beautiful her faith was.*

*This is the story of a faith that delighted Jesus. As such, it can be of great help for any person who has not yet come to faith in Christ. It can be of equally great help to the believer who is struggling with his or her faith in difficult circumstances. …*

*The mother was desperate and at the end of herself. She had heard of Jesus, perhaps through the testimony of a merchant who had seen him work miracles. She now believed that Jesus was her only hope—and that he could and would heal her daughter. She came in faith, and Jesus knew it. …*

*What was the result? Christ’s healing power. As Mark says: “Then he told her, ‘For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter’” (7:29). Her dear little daughter was completely restored.*
