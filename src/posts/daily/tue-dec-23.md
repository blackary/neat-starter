* The righteous live by faith.
* That means don’t sin and pull away from God.
* It also means enduring with God’s help.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How might Christians be tempted to deliberately sin?
2. How might Christians be suffering?
3. Where do we get the faith to live by?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	 

How is a Christian supposed to live? Does what you believe make a difference in how you live? Habakkuk was troubled by God’s astonishing announcement that He would use Babylon to punish Judah. Habakkuk waited for God’s answer, which in significant part was that *the righteous will live by his faith*.

Here the author of Hebrews gives the same instruction, quoting Habakkuk. So, what does living by faith look like? First, we are told what it doesn’t look like—that is, what we must not do if we truly are God’s people. Don’t deliberately go on sinning. The one who is pictured here is one who deliberately returns to a life of sin after having professed Christ. Be on guard if you are sinning deliberately, or even carelessly. And don’t reject saving grace—that is, don’t trample on Jesus and disregard the blood of His covenant. If you do these things you may well fall under God’s wrath.

We are also told what we should do as we live by faith. Endure suffering. Be confident that God will give you endurance. Even when struggling and suffering, remember that God has sustained you and will continue to sustain you. Remember what God has done in the past—throughout history and in your own life—and live believing that He will do what you need. Do not draw back and be destroyed, but live by faith and be saved.
