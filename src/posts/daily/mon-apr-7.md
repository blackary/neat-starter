### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Who are some “famous” people Jesus descended from?
2. Why did God give us these genealogies?
3. How do Jesus and Adam different as sons of God?

### Notes

Part of the reason for the genealogies in 1 Chronicles is to trace the heritage of Jesus. Chronicles lists only part of the way to Christ since others had not yet been born.  Here in our reading today, Luke gives a genealogy of Jesus. This list can be confusing, as between Joseph and David the lists of names are almost entirely different from Matthew’s list. Some think Luke’s genealogy is of Mary, others suggest individuals being known by multiple names may account for the differences.

While we might not finally know the reason for the differences in names, note other differences. Luke takes the descent all the way back to God. Again, Hughes notes that *this ending is one-of-a-kind... Luke’s ending the genealogy in this way shouts for attention. What Luke wants us to understand is that Adam was “the son of God” in the sense that all humans are the offspring of God,... But Jesus, the eternal Son of God, has become part of the human family and its flawed sonship (flawed because of Adam’s disobedience). The great thing about this is that Jesus exercises his perfect, eternal Sonship as he takes on Adam’s (and our) flawed sonship—and therefore he can redeem it*. Left to ourselves, we are sons of Adam and share in his guilt and sin. But all who put their trust in Jesus become, in Him, sons of God.
