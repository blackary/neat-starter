### *Listen up, little ones*

Listen for the word *prophesy*.

### Reading

Ezekiel 37:4-10—Prophesy to These Bones

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* God told Ezekiel to prophesy to the dead bones.
* God can make dead bones live—and he did!
* The Spirit of God brings life.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How do these bones live?
2. How do dead souls live?
3. How should we pray for those who are dead in their sin?

### Notes

(See last day for authors)	



All today’s notes are from Derek Thomas

*How do these bones live again? God uses three means to accomplish it.*

1. *The preaching of the Word
   Ezekiel is told to ‘prophesy’ (37:4; literally: ‘preach God’s Word’) and does as he is told (37:7).*
2. *The prayer of God’s servant
   God urges Ezekiel to call upon the ‘breath’ to come and breathe into the slain (37:9). As we have already seen, the passage uses the words ‘wind,’ ‘breath’ and ‘spirit’ interchangeably. Even though God may have promised something, he invariably links the promise with the prayers of his people.*
3. *The power of the Holy Spirit
   ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life’ (37:5; for ‘breath’ we can read ‘Spirit’).*

*These are the ingredients of any work of revival by God. It is the explanation of what occurred at Pentecost, when 3,000 people came to faith as the result of preaching (Acts 2:14–39), prayer (Acts 1:14) and the powerful work of the Holy Spirit (cf. Acts 2:18, 38).*
