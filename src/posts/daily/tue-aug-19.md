### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Who are Abraham’s descendants?
2. How can non-Jews be saved?
3. What impossible work has God done in saving you?

### Notes

(See last page for authors.)

Paul has used Abraham, then David, and now Abraham again to stress that righteousness is—and has always been--only by faith, not by works. The first lesson Paul makes on this return to Abraham’s faith is that Abraham’s faith and his justification by God make clear that Gentiles as well as Jews can be saved (and must be saved) in the same way. All along in Romans, Paul emphasizes that God’s way of salvation is for Jews—and for non-Jews. The gospel works for both. Both are guilty before God and without excuse. Both will be judged by God and condemned by God apart from the righteousness of God that is by faith in Jesus. Abraham received a credit for his faith unto righteousness before he was circumcised—**before** he was a Jew, if you will. And so, Abraham is the father of believing Gentiles (most of us) as well as of believing Jews.

Secondly, Paul shows what Abraham’s righteousness by faith looked like, with the implication that ours should look similar. It doesn’t come through the law. It trusts God’s promises even when they seem impossible. It believes that God can absolutely do the impossible. And the most impossible thing that God does in saving us is to give us life when we are dead. And this life comes only by faith.

As Hughes comments, *“Don’t be fooled,” says Paul in effect, “the principle of faith transcends the Law.” Abraham was credited as righteous because of his faith. So was David. Sola fide preceded the Jews; it preceded the Law; it is for everyone!*
