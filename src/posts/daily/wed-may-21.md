### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What did Esther have to ask the King to grant her?
2. How can we approach the throne of grace?
3. What do we receive when we do?

### Notes

Esther often had to ask for the King’s favor—even though she was the Queen! If she approached the King without being called, he had to extend favor or she would be killed. Sometimes Christians think, “I don’t have to ask for God’s favor. I don’t have to be concerned about approaching God.” While those thoughts are, for the most part, true, we need to consider why they are true. 

They are true because God invites us to approach him. They are true because he offers his favor. And both are true because of our great high priest, Jesus. We have this great high priest, Jesus. We have him. He is ours to claim by faith. Not that we earned him, but he was graciously given to us. We can say, He is *our* great high priest. We have a friend who is a teacher in Australia. He was told not to use the expression “my students.” He was told that expression is too possessive, that he and the students are “sharing a learning experience.” But we can say, “He is our great high priest.”

Therefore, we can draw near to the throne of Grace—with confidence. This gives us certainty that we can at any time and in any need come into God’s throne room of grace through our great High Priest Jesus and make our requests known to God. And we don’t just come, we come *boldly*! 

The throne that would otherwise dispense judgment is now, for you, because of Jesus, dispensing mercy, dispensing grace. Here we find favor!
