### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What is prayer?
2. What does it mean to pray in Jesus’s name?
3. What does Jesus promise when we pray in his name? Explain.

### Notes

Over and over in Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the temple, he asked God to hear from heaven, his dwelling place, and having heard, to answer. Jesus assures his disciples, and us, that when we ask in Jesus’s name, our prayers are heard and answered.

Hughes clarifies how we might understand this by saying that *before the cross the disciples either asked Jesus directly or prayed to the Father, as Christ taught them to pray: “Our Father in heaven …” (Matthew 6:9). After the cross a new arrangement was inaugurated—the disciples were to ask in Jesus’ name. That is why today we pray in Jesus’ name.*

*Unfortunately, some have interpreted this to mean that by tagging Jesus’ name on the end of their prayer, they can ask for what they want and they will get it*.

Hughes goes on to state that praying in Jesus’s name means *coming on the basis of his merit, not ours; … \[praying] in correspondence with Christ’s character and objectives; … and praying in submission to him*.

Might our prayers be constant and in Jesus’s name. Might we pray with an attitude of, *Hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people when they pray in Jesus’s Name. Hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, and when You hear, give answer*.
