### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. In what ways did Jesus grow up like we did?
2. Where did Jesus get wisdom?
3. What did Jesus never do that we do growing up (& grown up)?

### Notes

Joseph, Mary, and Jesus returned to their hometown, Nazareth. There, Jesus continued to grow up as any boy would. Hughes reminds us that *in the Incarnation, the infinite God both became finite man and remained infinite God. …. Truly human, the Son subjected himself to his own creation and its physical laws, its ups and downs. He would experience the development of human reason and language. He would be taught things he did not know. He walked like a baby before he walked like a man. He thought and talked like a baby before he thought and talked like a man*. 

As Jesus grew, we are told that he was filled with wisdom and that he increased in wisdom. And this was part of him growing up as a child in a home of parents who trained him in the things of the Lord. Jesus heeded the instruction of Proverbs 1: Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and don’t reject your mother’s teaching.

Calvin likewise notes that *it takes nothing from his glory, that he was altogether “emptied,” (Phil. 2:6,) neither does it degrade him, that he chose not only to grow in body, but to make progress in mind. …Christ received, in his human nature, according to his age and capacity, an increase of the free gifts of the Spirit, that “out of his fulness” (John 1:16) he may pour them out upon us; for we draw grace out of his grace*.
