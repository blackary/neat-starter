### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What are some differences between Psalms 9 and 10?
2. How might we account for these differences?
3. How can we and why should we “consider Jesus”?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

Psalms 9 and 10 are thought by many to have originally been one Psalm. In the Greek version of the Old Testament, they are one Psalm. They are written as an (incomplete) acrostic that spans across them both. But there are noticeable differences. In Psalm 9, David rejoices that God is the righteous judge. In Psalm 10, David seems to fear that the wicked are winning.  Psalm 9:9 states that the Lord is a refuge in times of trouble. Psalm 10:1 sees God as far away in these same times of trouble. How can one man, in perhaps the same Psalm, think both of these thoughts so closely together?

Ash suggests that we need, as *we approach this psalm, to be sensitive to the paradoxes inherent in the life of faith*. I get that. And you likely do too. In one breath, I am confident in God’s control. In the next breath, I see the strength of the wind and begin to sink. Or like the father who needed Jesus to heal his demon-possessed son, I implore, *I do believe, help my unbelief* (Mark 9:23–24).

Perhaps the key to which thought we have is our focus. Psalm 9 primarily focuses on God and His just judgment. Psalm 10 primarily focuses on the thoughts and actions of the wicked. Often, when we focus on the Lord, it is easier to rest in Him. When we focus on the unbelievers around us it is easier to fret and fear. 

May we constantly *consider him who endured such hostility from sinners against himself, so that we won’t grow weary and give up* (Heb 12:3).
