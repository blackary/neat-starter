### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the name *David* and the word *Philistine*.

### Reading

1 Samuel 17:23-54--God’s People have a Champion.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* David is a faithful and obedient son.
* David has already been anointed to be the next King of Israel.
* David defeats Goliath with a slingshot.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What did David hear?
2. What did David say?
3. What did David do?

### Notes

Goliath challenged Israel again—send your champion to fight against me. David, who had gone to the battle area to give food to his brothers because his dad told him to, heard Goliath. Woodhouse asks, *Did anyone notice? Did anyone care that young David from Bethlehem “heard”? Of course not. But this was the turning point in Israel’s fortunes, in Israel’s history, and therefore in world history!*

The terrified Israelites were talking about what great riches and honor King Saul would give someone who could beat Goliath in a fight. David heard this, too. Two things to keep in mind—we don’t know for sure that King Saul had actually promised this. More significantly, David’s primary concern was God’s honor. Three times he spoke of Goliath’s defiance of the armies of the living God. 

Further, David’s confidence was not in himself, even though he had previously killed lions and bears attacking the sheep that he kept. No, his confidence was in the LORD. The LORD of armies would deliver this enemy of God’s people into David’s hand.

And, as we well know, that is exactly what happened. David, with one sling of one stone killed Goliath—dropping him face-down, dead. David killed the giant! And, the moral of the story is that we can kill the giants in our lives too, right? Not exactly. (Come to worship to hear more…)
