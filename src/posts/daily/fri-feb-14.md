### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *you* and *I*

### Reading

Ruth 1:15-18—Where You Go, I Will Go

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Follow people who believe in God.
* Having God as our God is the right way to live.
* Even if Christians die, they are still with the Lord.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What was Naomi’s attitude toward the LORD?
2. What was Ruth’s attitude toward the LORD?
3. How might you change Ruth’s words to be your words to God?

### Notes

On this day, Valentine’s Day on our calendar, we come to a love story. A sweet love story. But not between a man and a woman (that comes later), but between a woman and her daughter-in-law. 

Noami, bitter and empty, decides to return to Bethlehem. She had heard there was food there again. She urged her daughters-in-law to stay in Moab.

But Ruth said, No. Don’t ask me to go back; I will go with you. And she speaks these sweet and deep words of committed love:

*Where you go, I will go<br>
where you live, I will live; <br>
your people will be my people, <br>
your God will be my God. <br>
Where you die, I will die, <br>
there I will be buried.<br>* 

These beautiful covenant words of commitment, though said from a daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law, are used often as part of wedding vows.

As we can see, Ruth’s faith in the covenant God, Yahweh, seems to be stronger than Noami’s at this point. She commits to the God of Israel, and even speaks of him with his covenant name, Yahweh (LORD in many English translations). Have you covenanted with the covenant LORD of Naomi and of Ruth? If not, do!
