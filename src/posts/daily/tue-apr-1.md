### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *sheep* and *follow*.

### Reading

John 10:1-30—Jesus’s sheep follow him

### Optional Reading

2 Kings 2:1-6

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus’s sheep follow him.
* As Elisha followed Elijah, so we should follow Jesus.
* Jesus helps us to follow him.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How did Elisha voice his commitment to following Elijah?
2. What are some reasons that we follow Jesus?
3. What kind of life does Jesus give those who follow him?

### Notes

Over and over in the gospels, Jesus commands people to follow him. He tells of the great cost of following him and the great value of following him. Elisha’s devoted following of Elijah in 2 Kings 2:1-6 sets an example for us in following Jesus. Three times he states *As certainly as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.* We would do well to imitate Elisha in this, but in following Jesus.

Here in John 10, Jesus reminds his disciples that he is the one who initiates and empowers us to follow him. He does it using an illustration often used in the Bible—sheep following their shepherd. Jesus is the shepherd and we follow him. We follow him because he calls us by name. We follow him because we know his voice. We follow him because he is the gate to salvation and an abundant life. We follow him. We follow him because he is the Good Shepherd. We follow him because he lays down his life for his sheep. We follow him because he knows us. We follow him, knowing that in him and in him alone, we have eternal life. And that eternal life is secured by the almighty power of the almighty God.
