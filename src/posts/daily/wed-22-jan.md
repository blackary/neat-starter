### Reading

1 Timothy 1:15-17 – Jesus Came to Save Sinners

### Notes

<div><small><i>Today’s notes are from a commentary on 1 Timothy by Kent Hughes.</i></small></div>

*Salvation for the worst. Now Paul’s very personal praise for grace widens to praise for its universal significance, beginning with the grand verse that made Thomas Bilney’s bones leap for joy: “Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst” (v. 15).*

*Some have accused the apostle of being disingenuous and projecting a false humility. The “worst” of sinners? The first (as the Greek says) of sinners? Numero uno? “Come on, Paul! There are far greater sinners than you! You never even dreamed of the sins I do.” But Paul was utterly sincere. What he says here is in perfect accord with what he says elsewhere of himself (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:9; Ephesians 3:8). This is authentic Pauline psychology and theology.*

*Also note that he did not say, “I was the worst of sinners, but “I am the worst.” This is the thinking of a healthy regenerate heart. Saving Christianity never endows one with a sense of superiority. Paul knew what he had been and what he was and what he continued to be in himself. This knowledge even increased with the years, as he understood his heart even better than at first. …*

*This is the very soul of the gospel—“Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst.” This is the awareness of a graced heart.*
