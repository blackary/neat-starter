* Haman wanted to destroy the Jews.
* Haman was instead destroyed.
* God spares his people.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What did Esther ask the king?
2. What was the king’s response?
3. What happened to Haman?

### Notes

At the end of chapter 6, Haman’s wife and friends told him that his downfall was certain (6:13) since he was opposing the Jews. In chapter 7 we see Haman’s downfall unfolded. God was preserving his people, which he will do. Haman had plotted to completely destroy the Jewish people (Esther 4). It is important to remember that the king had been in agreement with Haman’s plan to do that (Esther 3:1-9).

Esther asks that the Jewish people be spared and exposes Haman as the mastermind to carry out the planned destruction of the Jews. The king grants her request and sends Haman to be hung on the gallows he had prepared hoping to hang Mordecai. God again rescues his people! Even in this, God’s providence is evident. Although the king had permitted Haman to carry out his plan to destroy the Jews, it was apparently not written as an irrevocable royal edict (see 8:8, Daniel 6:8ff).

Does God always rescue his people from trouble? Although that is his pattern, at times he rescues them through trouble. Paul would later speak of God rescuing him from persecutions that he endured. And at times God’s rescue of his people is rescue in heaven. Our eternal rescue in Jesus is certain! With Job we can say, *I know that my Redeemer lives, … I will see God in my flesh* (Job 19:25–26).
