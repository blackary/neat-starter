### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *mouth*.

### Reading

Isaiah 53:7-9—Afflicted for Us

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus was innocent.
* Jesus died for our sins willingly.
* Jesus died for our sins knowingly.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why did Jesus not open his mouth?
2. How do we know that Jesus died willingly?
3. Where was Jesus buried?

### Notes

The prophet Isaiah continues to describe the suffering of this servant. Not only is he punished for us, but he is also afflicted for us. In all of this he didn’t fight back or even speak back. Sometimes someone might have nothing to say if they are guilty of what they are charged with, but Jesus—this servant—had no guilt of his own. Further if we read the New Testament accounts, even the charges by the Jewish leaders were false and contradictory. Someone also might not speak if they were being led to slaughter but were ignorant of what was coming—like the lamb of which Isaiah speaks. But Jesus went willingly and knowingly to die.

Ortland notes that *the death of Jesus was a miscarriage of human justice, but it was also our Lord’s clearheaded choice. He wasn’t caught in a web of events beyond his own control. He willingly laid his life down (John 10:17, 18)*.

Because of his willingness to lay down his life for sinners who are guilty, we can be saved. Yet the cost for him was beyond comprehension. Innocent, yet condemned. Struck not for his failures, but for our rebellion. Afflicted and oppressed for us!
