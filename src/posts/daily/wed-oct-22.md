* One day we will all meet Jesus face to face.
* He will either say, “Depart!” or “Welcome!”
* If he says, “Welcome,” it’s all of grace.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How can we be prepared to meet Jesus face to face?
2. Why will some say to Jesus “Lord, Lord” and not be accepted?
3. What does grace do for us?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

Joel tells his readers to prepare to meet their God. In our reading, Jesus speaks of that day when we do meet our God. Jesus makes clear that not all who profess Christ will enter heaven. Only those who do God’s will, will. 

So, examine the fruit of your life. Jesus makes clear that signs and wonders are not enough—even done in Jesus's name. You must be known by Christ. What terrifying words it would be to hear as we meet God, "I never knew you; depart from me!" Instead, I want to know Christ and be known by him. I want to make a practice of Christianity as well as a profession of it. On that day, I want to hear, “Enter into the joy of your lord.”

And if I hear that, I know that it is all of grace! By grace I have been saved and created in Christ Jesus to do good works (Eph 2:8-10). By the grace of God, I am what I am (1 Cor. 15:10). The grace of God that brought salvation also instructs us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way while we wait to meet Jesus (Titus 2:11-13). He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people for his own possession, eager to do good works (Titus 2:14 CSB).
