### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why did Edom fight against Judah?
2. Why did God judge Edom?
3. How can anyone be rescued from God’s judgment?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are from a commentary on Obadiah by Trent Butler)	

*Obadiah preached to Judah about Edom, an enemy of Judah at the time (586 B.C.). Edom had been Judah’s ally and treaty partner since the two nations were close geographical neighbors and shared a common ancestry (Gen. 36). Sadly the nations also shared a history of enmity and violence.*

*Judah didn’t need other enemies. Babylon had just destroyed Jerusalem and had leveled the temple. And now Judah was supposed to learn lessons from the fate of their hated enemy. The lessons are quite simple: God will punish the sins of pride, self-reliance, betrayal, and boasting over one’s friends and partners. … Edom’s punishment was time for Judah to celebrate God’s kingship and devote themselves to proper worship of the eternal King until he brings Obadiah’s promises to pass. …*

*Obadiah challenges us to face our own pride and self-reliance, to ask God for forgiveness, to promise to let him erase these character traits from our lives, to let God insert humility into our lives in pride’s place, to trust God for deliverance from life’s problems rather than trying always to do it ourselves. Obadiah has one subtle lesson that many of us need to listen to and heed. He calls us to examine family relationships with immediate family and extended family. Pride and self-reliance can block us from reconciliation and peace with our families.*

*All things work together for good. Full stop. For everyone. Always. I mean, that’s what the Bible says, right? No, sorry, that’s not exactly what the Bible says. But what the Bible says is actually better—for some people—and it is a sweet call to others to turn in love to God.*
