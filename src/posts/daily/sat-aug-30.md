### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *law, statutes, testimonies, decrees*.

### Reading

Psalm 119:1-8—I Seek You, LORD

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Psalm 119 is full of terms of God’s instruction like law/precepts.
* Psalm 119 is full of 1st and 2nd person singular pronouns.
* Psalm 119 helps us talk to and love the Lord better.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What are many terms of God’s instruction?
2. How does Psalm 119 help us talk to God?
3. How does Psalm 119 teach us about God?

### Notes

(See below for all authors)	

I think, for our joint service at Black Forest Reformed Church, the sermon will be from Psalm 119. Powlison asks, *When you hear the words “Psalm 119,” what are your first associations? … I suspect that your heart does not immediately come up with the following … Psalm 119 is where I go to learn how to open my heart about what matters, to the person I most trust. I affirm what I most deeply love. I express pure delight.	I lay my sufferings and uncertainties on the table. 	I cry out in need and shout for joy. I hear how to be forthright without self-righteousness. I hear how to be weak without self-pity. I learn how true honesty talks with God: fresh, personal, and direct; never formulaic, abstract, or vague. I hear firsthand how Truth and honesty meet and talk it over. This Truth is never denatured, rigid, or inhuman. This honesty never whines, boasts, rages, or gets defensive. I leave the conversation nourished by the sweetest hope imaginable. I hear how to give full expression to what it means to be human, in honest relationship with the Person who made humanness in his image*. …

Powlison then says *the Psalm is full of this thought: I, your servant, talk to you, LORD, who speaks and acts, whom I need and love*.
