### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *things*.

### Reading

Romans 8:28-30—All Things Work for Good

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Bad things happen, even to Christians.
* God works all those things for good for us.
* We need to trust God on this.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Is everything that happens good? Explain.
2. How do we know that God works all things for good for those who love him?
3. What is God’s ultimate purpose for us?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors. Today’s notes are taken from a devotional on Romans by R.C. Sproul)	 

*When certain actions take place, they are simply evil; nevertheless, under the providence of God, under His sovereignty over human events, He has the power to bring good out of them, which is a glorious thing that we can experience as Christians. Everything that we are called upon to suffer, even things that are truly bad, are nevertheless being used by God for our ultimate good. Viewed from a proximate perspective, such actions are indeed bad, and there is no redemptive virtue in them, but from the ultimate perspective it is good that they are happening because God is using them for His ultimate purpose. That is a critical point to grasp if we are to understand anything of the providence of God.*

*“All things work together for good . . .” Do you believe it? Let us remember this truth in our daily lives moment by moment, but especially when we encounter suffering. We can know that all things work together for good because God is good. Holding fast to this truth, we protect ourselves from ever casting even the smallest shadow of doubt on the goodness of God, and we get to experience His goodness as He brings us through suffering with deeper measures of trust and humility.*
