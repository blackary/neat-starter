### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

Obadiah warned of the coming judgment—not just against Edom, but against all the nations. Jesus warns of his judgment that is coming. Yet even in his promise of judgment, he also promises life to whomever he chooses to give it. So, on the one hand, we must believe in and proclaim Jesus as the coming Judge, but on the other hand we must believe in and proclaim Jesus as the Redeemer—of sinners like us. As Calvin notes, *let us therefore keep Christ before our eyes, as he was sent into the world by the Father to be a Redeemer*.

Hendriksen comments that *\[making alive] the dead and pronouncing judgment were the two greater works which the Father had assigned to the Son. Judgment is deserved by all. Life received from Jesus is a free gift of his grace.*

Do you know Jesus this way—as one who will judge and as one who can give life? Has he given you life? John would later write that his account of Jesus *was written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name* (John 20:31 CSB). Have you believed and received life in his name? And, having believed it, are you telling of his great works—the coming judgment and the provision of life instead of judgment for all who believe in him?
