### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *beautiful*.

### Reading

Song of Solomon 1:12-17—You Are Beautiful, My Love

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Intimate love is good in marriage.
* Love involves emotion and action.
* We all should love Jesus most.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why should husbands and wives desire each other?
2. Why does love sometimes fade?
3. How do you know if you love Jesus?

### Notes

Today’s notes are from a commentary on the Song of Songs by Douglas Sean O’Donnell

*How do we apply this ancient Hebrew poem to our contemporary American lives? Below are four applications.
The first application is this: desire is not demonic. … That is, this desire for sexual intimacy expressed here so obviously is not only natural but can be (should be) naturally good. … It is natural to desire, but don’t let the natural neutralize the ethical. We are to glorify God with our bodies (1 Corinthians 6:20), and glorifying God means playing by his rules. … So, desire is dangerous but not demonic.*

*The second application is that character and chemistry both matter in the matters of love. … Know that. Apply that. …*

*The third application is that that first flame of desire (which is depicted colorfully here) need not (ought not!) die out after the honeymoon. Put more succinctly: that first flame need not fizzle. …* 

*Our final application is an application to all Christians, and it has to do with our desire for Christ: Just as your desire for intimacy with your spouse is a reliable indicator of your marital health, so too your desire for intimacy with Christ is a reliable indicator of your spiritual health.*
