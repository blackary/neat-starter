### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. When is God good?
2. How does Jeremiah know/remember that God is good?
3. For whom does God work good?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

Jeremiah continues, in the middle of destruction and lament, finding hope in God. Often when nice things happen to us, we exclaim, “God is good!” The danger is that we might think God is good when things are going well, but when things are going pear-shaped, we might not. Someone in our extended family often says, “God is good – all the time.” That is a helpful way to remember what Jeremiah exclaims here. God is good. All the time. 

God is good, Jeremiah says, even in calamity. How does Jeremiah know? How do we know?

God controls all things. V28 – see Jer 32:42. Everything is under His control Not one solitary molecule is not. Calamity might be due to my own sin. It clearly is in Lamentations; it often is in life. 	If you face trouble or calamity directly due to your own sin or to the direct sin of others, God is still in control.

God works all things for good. How could there be good from destruction of Jerusalem? 	Discipline for some Jews to the saving of their souls v40-42 5:21. God will bring about the exile v31. Ultimately, God will bring about the incarnation as the only true hope.

But is it good for everyone? Does God work all things for good for the entire human race? No. God is good to those who are His. And those who are His will hope in Him (v21,24,26). Those who are His will wait and look eagerly for Him v25. Those who are His will seek Him v25b. Are you His? He is good and will work good for you.
