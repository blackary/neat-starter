### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Is Jesus the Christ? How do we know?
2. What do Jesus’ sheep do?
3. What does Jesus do for His sheep? 

### Notes

(See below for all authors)	

Although the time changes (two months pass between vs. 21 and 22), in many ways the conversation does not. The Jews ask Jesus, “Are you the Christ?” (The Messiah—God’s promised and anointed King). Jesus answers in terms of sheep and shepherds.

Jesus had told them often that He was from the Father, doing things that only God’s anointed King could do (see 5:26-27, 6:29, 51, 7:37-38, 8:23-24, 10:10). But for some of these Jews, that wasn’t good enough. But rather than simply satisfy their “itching ears,” Jesus tells them why they don’t believe.

They don’t believe He is the Christ, doing the things that only God’s anointed King could do, because they are not following Him. They are not His sheep. Both their own sinful rebellion against Jesus and God’s eternal decree prevent them from understanding. In contrast, those who are Jesus’s sheep follow Him. They are no more worthy of salvation, but they are saved and eternally kept by Jesus and His Father.

Are you hearing Jesus’s voice and following Him? Rejoice! He has secured a place for you in Heaven. He gave you eternal life. You will never perish. No one (not even you) can take you from His and His Father’s powerful and protective hands.
