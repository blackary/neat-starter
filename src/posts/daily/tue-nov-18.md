### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

Jesus bore man’s rage. But not for his sin or wrongdoing. He bore man’s rage and God’s curse for all who would believe in Him. For you—if you have repented and believed (or will). Though Jesus faced the verdict of Pilate, the mocking and beatings of the Roman soldiers, he faced that for you. He was there in mercy.

The soldiers and the Jews mocked the name of Jesus. But today might Jesus be asking us, How many times did you shout My Name in shock or surprise? How many times did you use it as a curse? How many times did you think small of my judgment by damning this or that? His name is used in these ways every day. But by his grace we now proclaim, “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!" We say in reverent worship, “Hail King of the Jews!”

In his crucifixion, Jesus bore your curse. He was stripped in order to clothe you in His righteous robes. He suffered—and died—so that you might live. So live! Live for Him. Run to Jesus! Delight yourself in the Lord. 

O’Donnell gives three points of application: *our first point of application is: acknowledge him. We are to acknowledge Jesus as a paradoxical suffering sovereign or crucified king. ... As we move next to our second point, we pause to gaze—on your knees if able—at Jesus with gratitude. Thank him is our second application. ... \[Thirdly] we are to imitate Simon the Cyrene as he imitates Jesus the Christ. We too are to carry Christ’s cross. … our imitation of Christ is cross-shaped.* 

Glory will one day come! But for now, we take up our cross daily and follow Him.
