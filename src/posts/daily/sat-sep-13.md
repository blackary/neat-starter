### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *furnace* and *four*.

### Reading

Daniel 3:19-25 The Deliverer: One Like the Son of God

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Nebuchadnezzar had Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego thrown into the blazing furnace.
* The fire was so hot the men who threw them in died.
* Yet four men walked around in the fire. One looked like a god.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Why was Nebuchadnezzar so angry?
2. How did he respond to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego’s courage?
3. What happened to them in the furnace? 

### Notes

(See below for all authors)	

Sometimes we might hope that our courageous convictions will be noticed, even by non-Christians, and that we might be accepted. That didn’t happen with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Not at all! King Nebuchadnezzar was so mad that he ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter and had these three men tied up and thrown into the furnace. It was so hot that the men who threw these three men in died from the flames. So, certainly young Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego died too. Right?

Actually, and we are very familiar with the story, that’s not what happened. Olyott notes that these *three uncompromising believers were thrown into the fire. In the fire they received deliverance. We need to notice that they received deliverance **in** the fire, and not **from** the fire*.

Much to King Nebuchadnezzar’s amazement, the furnace didn’t hold three burnt men—but rather four men unbound, walking around in the fire unharmed. The fourth, Nebuchadnezzar shouts, looks like a god! Was this Jesus in an Old Testament appearance? Likely. Did the king realize that? Likely not. But we do. And our God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—will deliver us. Eternally.
