### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *my* and *I*. 

### Reading

Habakkuk 3:16-19—Quietly Wait and Rejoice—No Matter What.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Difficulties are difficult.
* Sometimes our bodies painfully feel our difficulties.
* Yet, we can wait on God and rejoice in Him—always.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What was Habakkuk’s physical response to God’s doings?
2. Why is it so hard to wait on the Lord?
3. How can we rejoice in the Lord, no matter what?

### Notes

(See below for all authors. )	

Knowing what God had done in the past, and knowing what was coming, brought physical turmoil to Habakkuk. Smith comments that *first, his body trembled. Second, his lips quivered at the thunderous voice of God (cf. Ps 29:3–5, 7–9). Third, he felt that his bones were rotting away within him, i.e., his frame did not seem to be strong enough to hold him up. Fourth, his legs were trembling under him.*

We might experience some sense of that inner, even physical, turmoil when facing difficulty. Yet Habakkuk not only tells of the effect of knowing what God will do—bringing Babylon to discipline His people—but also that he will wait quietly for that distress to come. Calvin notes that *this exhortation is also very necessary for us in the present day. … except God’s judgment awakens us, yea, and reduces us almost to nothing.* In the knowledge of God’s judgment and of God’s deliverance, the believer can rest.

Habakkuk not only waits, but he rejoices. He rejoices! Even when all is going horribly, even when it seems like there is no hope, God is my hope! God is my portion. God is my salvation!
