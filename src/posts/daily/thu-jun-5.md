### *Listen up, little ones*

Listen for the word *blessed* (or *happy*)..

### Reading

Psalms 1-2—Who is Blessed?

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Psalms 1-2 show how to be blessed.
* Psalms 1-2 show the danger of being against God.
* Both the blessed and the non-blessed will come to an end.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How is one blessed in Psalm 1?
2. How is one blessed in Psalm 2?
3. What ends are given in these psalms? And for whom?

### Notes

Psalms 1 and 2 are sometimes called the “twin pillars” of the Psalms. In many ways they introduce the material of the Psalter. And, reading them together, they begin and end with a description of blessed people. To be blessed is to be in a position to be happy due to the kindnesses of God. The Hebrew word is plural which Boice notes *denotes either a multiplicity of blessings or an intensification of them*.

And in both of these Psalms the blessed ones are set in contrast with others who are in a different position. In Psalm 1 the contrast is between the righteous and the wicked. The blessed one is the one who, rather than loving the ways of the wicked, loves the law of God. In Psalm 2 the contrast is between the ones who seek to escape the rule of God and His Christ and the ones who place their trust in the Lord’s Ruling Son.

Putting them together, then, we see that the one who loves Christ also loves God’s law. In contrast, the wicked one rejects God’s law and God’s Son. Which one are you? One will receive God’s abundance of blessedness. The other will be destroyed in God’s righteous judgment.
