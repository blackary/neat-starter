### Reading

John 20:30–31—So that you may believe

### Notes

<div><small><i>Today’s notes are from a commentary on John by Paul Barnett.</i></small></div>

*After narrating this sequence of resurrection appearances, John states his aim in writing this Gospel. It is that those who read will ‘believe’ that Jesus is the Son of God. … The purpose of the Gospel is for people to become and be believers.*

*John teaches many important truths about his Gospel in these few words.*

*(i) The reference to ‘other signs’ emphasises the preeminence of the ‘sign’ of Jesus’ bodily resurrection.*

*(ii) John writes as an eyewitness, who had been ‘present’ from first to last …*

*(iii) In writing his Gospel, John has selected only some of Jesus’ miracles that he witnessed. There were many ‘others’, as reference to the Gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke indicates.*

*(iv) John’s words show that ‘believing’ arose equally from a written Gospel as from a spoken message. Paul said that ‘faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of Christ’ (Romans 10:17). The Gospel John wrote was to be read aloud and heard, in a congregational setting.*

*(v) …The present tense verb tells us that John wants his readers to ‘go on believing’ …*

*(vi) John promises that those who believe in Jesus as Messiah and the divine Son already ‘have’ eternal life … . The Son of God is the source of eternal life so that to embrace him by faith is to possess eternal life in the kingdom of God.*
