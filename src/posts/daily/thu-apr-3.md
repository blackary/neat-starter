### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *sons* and *fathered*.

### Reading

1 Chronicles 1—The Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Lots of names are listed here.
* Some of them we know from the rest of the Bible.
* This list of names tells us about God’s work in the world.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. Can you think of any ways these names from today’s reading point us to Christ?
2. For which names are we told more than just their names?
3. Who is our first father?

### Notes

A person reading through the Bible from cover to cover for the first time might grind to a halt at 1 Chronicles 1-9. This list of names, many of them unfamiliar and hard to pronounce, can be confusing and off-putting (why so many names?).

But God breathed out these words just as he did the book of Romans. That is not to say that the gospel is as clearly spelled out in 1 Chronicles 1-9 as it is in Romans 3-6. But these God-breathed chapters are still useful. What might we be able to learn?

Corduan suggests that *the Israelites could trace their descent from Adam to Jacob, the father of the twelve tribes, by way of Seth, Noah, and Abraham. Just as they could look back on a great heritage, so we can look back on a heritage of God’s grace in the lives of people who came before us. Just as they needed to live up to God’s calling, so we need to pass the treasure of God’s gospel on to the next generation.*

Boda notes that *the genealogies foreshadow some of the key theological themes, … and narrative characters of the \[book].*

Since we are looking at people (types) and themes that point to Christ, we would do well to consider how these lists of names point us to Christ. Can you think of any from today’s reading?

### Swedish Method questions

<div><small><i>See the Sunday reading for meaning of the symbols.</i></small></div>

### Praise

Psalm 71c, 10a

### Prayer

1. Ask God to help you understand how even these lists of names point to Christ.
2. Pray for the preparation for preaching God’s word this Sunday.
3. Pray for a member of our church, for your family, and for a non-Christian friend/family member.
