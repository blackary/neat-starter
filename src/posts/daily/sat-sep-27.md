### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *God* and *children*.

### Reading

Hosea 1:10-2:1—They Will Be Called: Sons of the Living God.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* God will again have compassion.
* God will again call His people His children.
* After scattering His people, God will again gather them.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How are each of the three children’s names reversed in these verses?
2. What has caused God to fix the mess of His people’s rebellion?
3. How will Christ complete this work?

### Notes

(See below for all authors)	

Here the horrible mess God’s people have put themselves in is resolved. But not by them. “But I (God) v7.” “Yet…” v9. God will do something to fix the mess. V7 hints at this and these three verses give more details. 

God demonstrates this by reversing the meaning of the names He had Hosea give his three children. The little boy named “Not My People” would instead be called “My People” (2:1) and “Sons of the living God.” Young “No Compassion” would be called “Compassion.” And, small “God Scatters” would now be known as “God sows.” Smith notes that *God’s scattering in judgment now becomes God’s sowing for growth.*

All this will be done by God because of His mercy. And it will be completed in the work of Christ. As the RSB notes *“one head” reveals the completeness of reconciliation between both kingdoms and the Lord. Ultimately, this reunion takes place under Christ, the son of David (Matt. 1:23; 2:6, 15).*
