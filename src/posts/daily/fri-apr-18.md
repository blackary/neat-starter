* Jesus has the most important name.
* Jesus’s name calls us to worship him.
* Everyone will eventually bow their knee to Jesus.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why was Jesus exalted? 
2. How was Jesus exalted by God, the Father?
3. How is Jesus exalted by you?

### Notes

Christ—the eternal Son of God—died a painful, unfair, agonizing, obedient death. For us—us Christians. But He didn’t stay dead! He didn’t stay dead!

Because Jesus emptied Himself and died an obedient death, God raised Him from the dead and raised Him up to the very highest place. Hughes notes that *Paul says literally “Therefore God super-exalted him” (v. 9a). Christ received the highest exaltation. This is incomprehensible. It is in a class by itself*.

Ellsworth comments that *having completed the work of redemption on the cross and having risen from the dead, the Lord Jesus ascended to the Father in heaven (Acts 1:1–11), where he now reigns in exaltation. The Father has given him ‘the name which is above every name’ (v. 9). Debate swirls around this name, but this is beyond debate: every knee is going to bow in submission before the exalted Christ and every tongue is going to confess that he is Lord of all*.

If you have never bowed your knee before this exalted Jesus, do it. Do it today. Do it now. Everyone will. But, for some, it will be a forced kneeling that comes too late and brings no wonder, joy, or eternal glory. 

And if you have bowed your knee before Him, then exalt Him. Exalt Him—you have in yourself the mind of Christ
