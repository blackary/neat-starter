### *Listen up, little ones*

Listen for the words *cup* and *bread*.

### Reading

1 Corinthians 10:14–22—Sharing the Blood and Body of Christ

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus has given special events for his church.
* These events, called sacraments, are to signify and seal God’s covenant relationship with his people.
* One of those events is the Lord’s Supper, where we spiritually feed on Jesus’s body and blood.

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

For the next few months in preparation for communion we will read through a modern English revision of the Westminster Larger Catechism on the Lord’s Supper	

*Q162. What is a sacrament?*

*A.	 A sacrament is an holy ordinance appointed by Christ in His church to signify, seal and set forth to those who are within the covenant of grace, the benefits of his mediation; to strengthen and increase their faith and all other graces; to oblige them to obedience; to testify and cherish their love and communion with one another; and to mark them off from those who are outside.*

*Q168. What is the Lord’s Supper?*

*A.	The Lord’s Supper is a sacrament of the New Testament in which, by giving and receiving bread and wine according to the appointment of Jesus Christ, his death is proclaimed, and those who receive rightly feed on his body and blood to their spiritual nourishment and growth in grace; have their union and communion with him confirmed; and testify to and renew their thankfulness and pledge to God, and their mutual love and fellowship with each other, as members of the same mystical body.*
