### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. What does Jesus do as the door of the sheep-pen?
2. What does the thief do?
3. What does Jesus offer instead?

### Notes

In contrast with the discouraging brevity and emptiness of life that the Preacher in Ecclesiastes speaks of—and in contrast with the destructive work of the thief here—Jesus offers abundance! He offers this as the Good Shepherd. We don’t know much about sheep in our lives these days, but it is an image used all throughout the Bible. Sheep need a shepherd. Sheep need to be led.

Jesus, as the good shepherd, identifies himself as the door to the sheep-pen. As the door, Jesus offers protection for the sheep as no one can come in except coming through him. He also offers provision as he leads the sheep out of the pen.

In addition to that great claim of protection and provision, Jesus also offers abundance. Not like the Pharisees who tied up heavy burdens for any who would follow them and who rejected Jesus’s healing work as Sabbath-breaking rather than as gospel evidence. They could only steal, kill, and destroy. Jesus, by contrast, gives abundant life. Hughes notes that *Scripture portrays the great shepherd leading his sheep into green pastures beside still waters, pursuing the strays, keeping them away from the poisonous plants, taking them to the good water, making sure they have life and abundance, providing everything for their health.* All this, for dumb sheep, as we follow our good shepherd.
