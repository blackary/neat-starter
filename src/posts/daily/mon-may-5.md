### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. How is anointed used in the Old Testament?
2. What does it mean that Jesus is the Lord’s Anointed One?
3. What is the gospel work that God gave Jesus?

### Notes

Jesus is the Lord’s Anointed One. The Old Testament word typically translated as anointed one, as the TWOT notes, *is almost exclusively reserved as a synonym for “king” as in poetry where it is in parallel position with king (I Sam 2:10; II Sam 22:51; cf. Ps 2:2; 18:50… Striking are the phrases “the Lord’s anointed” or equivalents such as “his anointed” referring to kings. Certainly a title of honor, the expressions also emphasize the special relationship between God and the anointed*. It is also used of Cyrus as we considered yesterday.

Here in our reading today, Jesus reads from the scroll of Isaiah (61:1-2 in our Bibles) about one who is anointed by the Spirit of the Lord . Then he claims (truthfully) that this Scripture was written about him and is fulfilled in the hearing of those at the synagogue.

The anointed kings and priests in the Old Testament pointed to Jesus. He is the Great Anointed One. As such, he is both King and Priest. He is given authority to serve—ALL authority—as he proclaims in the Great Commission (Matt 28:16-20). He is given the task, by God his Father, of both preaching and being the good news—that is, the gospel of salvation for all who repent and believe.
