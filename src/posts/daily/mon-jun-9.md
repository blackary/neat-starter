### Questions

<div><small><i>(Some read the ?s before the notes/ ask them after.)</i></small></div>

1. Why can the blessed man in Psalm 1 only fully be Jesus?
2. Why did Jesus have to suffer and die?
3. Is Jesus ashamed of us as his brothers and sisters? Explain.

### Notes

The Blessed Man in Psalm 1 is pointing to Jesus. Jesus is the only one who loves God and his law perfectly, who never was led astray by a sinner. Here in our reading, we see Jesus. We see Jesus being made perfect. Not that he was ever not perfect, but more in the sense that his suffering as the Blessed, Righteous Man proved his perfection to all. So, we see him suffering and dying. 

Why should the perfect God-man die?! In order to save all whom the Father had given Him (John 17:6,9,12). Kistemaker notes that *Jesus experienced death in the greatest degree of bitterness … as the sinless Savior who died to set sinners free from the curse of spiritual death*.

By His perfect obedience and willing death for His people, Jesus accomplished all that man could not. In Him, all creation is subject to the Man—Jesus—who reigns supreme over all!

We might think that this perfect One would scorn the imperfect ones whose sin He had to undo, whose failures He had to make right. But we would misunderstand grace if we thought that. Instead, this perfect man is not ashamed to call us his brothers! This “perfect pioneer” who secured our glory and salvation is our elder brother. And even though our sin took Him to suffer and die on the cross, in spite of all that, He is not ashamed of us as His brothers!
