### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the word *dogs*.

### Reading

Mark 7:24-30—The Children’s Crumbs

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* Jesus tells this woman he has to feed the children.
* She asks him for just crumbs.
* Jesus responds to her with mercy.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What did the woman need?
2. Why did Jesus seem to initially resist?
3. What did Jesus do for the woman and her daughter?

### Notes

(Today’s notes are from a commentary on Mark by Steve Wilmshurst.)	*There are two reasons why \[Jesus] speaks \[to this woman] as he does.* 

*One is that he is simply telling the truth. Jesus’ mission at this point is focused on the Jews. … The children must be fed; he cannot take their bread and fling it to the dogs. The Jews come first in the purposes of God.*

*But there is a second reason for Jesus’ response. We know that from the way the story concludes. In the end, Jesus will not reject this woman. This verdict about the children and the dogs is not the final word. Jesus is testing her to see how she herself will respond to such a blunt judgement. If Jesus’ response shocks us, the woman’s reply to him is breathtaking (7:28). She makes just a small change to the picture he has painted. In the scene she describes, the dogs are under the table, where they can pick up the crumbs that fall from the master’s table—but they are still dogs! She is willing to take the lowly position he has assigned her. In effect she is saying, ‘I understand that the Jews are your first love and they demand all your attention. But surely there are some small leftovers for me? Surely you can drop me a few crumbs? That is all I am asking!’  … She puts his own dull, male disciples to shame! She does so, not by being proud and laying down the law, as the Pharisees have done; not by trying to outwit him with smart arguments, as the Sadducees would do; but, wonderfully, by listening to his words, looking into his face and asking him for mercy.*
