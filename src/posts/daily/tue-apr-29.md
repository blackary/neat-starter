* They were saved by faith in Jesus.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. With what power did the gospel come to Thessalonica?
2. How were the Thessalonians changed?
3. What were these (and all) Christians saved from?

### Notes

At the end of 2 Chronicles, God brings mercy to release his people from captivity in Babylon. This was in order to keep the promise God had made through Jeremiah that after 70 years he would release his people. That promise is made repeatedly in Jeremiah, perhaps most clearly in Jeremiah 29:10–14.

For this is what the LORD says: “When seventy years for Babylon are complete, I will attend to you and will confirm my promise concerning you to restore you to this place. For I know the plans I have for you”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“plans for your well-being, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. You will call to me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart. I will be found by you”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “I will restore you to the place from which I deported you.”

At the end of Paul’s introduction to the saints in Thessalonica, Paul echoes the kindness of God toward his people. God reached out to them through the preached word and saved them, changed them, rescued them. Thanks be to God that he rescues sinners like me through Jesus Christ.
