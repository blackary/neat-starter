### Notes

(See Saturday for authors)	

Ezekiel was asked an impossible question—*Can these dead, dry, bones live*? He wisely said, *Lord, only you know*. And then the Lord did something impossible. He made those dead, dry bones live.

Jesus and his disciples encountered a young man who seemed to have everything—except eternal life! And it seemed that he wanted to have eternal life. Maybe he thought he could buy it. Certainly, he thought he could somehow earn it. But Jesus told him to sell everything he had, give the money to the poor, and follow Jesus. He didn’t want eternal life that badly! So, he went away sad.

Jesus then described something that seemed impossible. *It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God*. Those who sew will know that it can be difficult to put a thread through the eye of a needle, let alone a camel. We laugh at the thought, and that’s the point. Jesus wants us to think about something else that is impossible.

Someone saving themselves is impossible. But it’s not impossible for God to save someone. God can make dead bones live. God can save a rich person or a poor person—neither of which can save themselves. God can save and perhaps has saved—you.
