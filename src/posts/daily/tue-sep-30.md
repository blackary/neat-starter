### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. How and when has God spoken?
2. What is unique about Jesus as one by whom God speaks?
3. Who is Jesus according to these verses?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	 

God, who is there, is not silent. Some view God, if they allow that He exists, as a distant creator who may have created the world but has since left this world alone. But God is. And God has spoken.

The unknown human author writing to Hebrew (Jewish) Christians begins his message telling us some of how God has spoken—at various times/ways in time past vs. in these last days; to the fathers vs. to us; by the prophets vs. by His Son

By His Son. With those words the author introduces us to Jesus Christ, the messenger of God whom he will reveal in His glory and on His throne throughout this book. Yet Jesus is not only the messenger of God—He is God. And He is also the message itself, as Andrews notes, *only by seeking Him can we discover what God has to say to us*.

This Son, through whom God has spoken, is now revealed to us gloriously. God saved the best word for last. God spoke through His Son—the God-man who is king. Jesus brought the word of God. He fulfilled the promise of the prophet who would come (Deut. 18:15) and the promised messenger whom God would send (Mal. 3:1). But Jesus also IS the word of God. Jesus is the messenger but also the message. He doesn’t just direct us to God, but to himself as the only way to God. God’s word by Jesus was the best because Jesus is the best!
