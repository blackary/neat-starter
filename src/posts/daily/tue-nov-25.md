### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read the ?s before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What is the difference between the shepherd and the thief?
2. In what ways is Jesus the beautiful Shepherd?
3. What is the significance of Jesus laying down His life?

### Notes

(See Saturday for authors.)	

Micah 5 introduces a coming Shepherd-King. Jesus in our reading today introduces himself as the good shepherd. Having healed a blind man (chapter 9) and been confronted by the Pharisees (who were blind to their blindness), Jesus explains how He is different from the Jewish religious leaders. They are thieves and robbers. They do not enter by the door of the sheepfold. They do not have sheep willingly following them because they are strangers to the sheep. Jesus, on the other hand, is the door to the sheepfold and enters by that door. His sheep hear His voice and know Him. When He calls them by name, they come out and follow Him.

This is serious business, as Jesus indicates by His introduction “truly, truly” (or “most assuredly”). It makes an eternal difference who we are following. Likened to sheep—defenseless and not particularly smart creatures—we need to be sure who it is we are following. If you are following anyone else but Jesus, your false shepherd will steal your eternity.

The “good” of this Good Shepherd describes something that is beautiful. Hughes notes that *such is the shepherd we proclaim. He is altogether lovely—this beautiful Jesus, our shepherd. Why is he so beautiful? Because of the way he relates to us, calls us by name, and knows us, and because we know him and he sees to our every need. … Because he is the door, and when we go in, we find protection and salvation. And when we go out, we find pasture and abundant life. … Because of his heart. Because he laid down his life for his sheep*.
