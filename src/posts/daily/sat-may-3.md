### *Listen up, little ones*

<div><small><i>Especially for the littles in your household.</i></small></div>

Listen for the words *broke* and *bread*.

### Reading

1 Corinthians 11:23-34—Jesus broke the bread.

### *Keys for kids*

<div><small><i>Also for the littles. Young households might choose, after Keys for Kids, to go directly to praise and prayer.</i></small></div>

* After Jesus blessed the bread, he broke it.
* Jesus was broken for our sins.
* Jesus paid the penalty for our sins.

### Questions

<div><small><i>(some read these before notes, then ask them after)</i></small></div>

1. What are the three acts we have considered so far?
2. Why was Christ broken?
3. What happens in atonement?

### Notes

(From the Young People's manual of RPCNA) *Remember, we are considering the six significant acts to be understood as we come to the table of the Lord. The first act was that Jesus took bread. The second significant act was that he blessed the bread.*

*The next act, set forth in the words, "He broke it," was significant because of the crucifixion.  Christ, since he had become our substitute, had to pay the penalty which our sins incurred.  "This is my body which is broken for you."  It was broken to atone for our guilt, to make expiation for our sins, so that the claims which God, in his infinite justice, held against us might be satisfied.  As we see the bread broken we are to remember that the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all (Isaiah. 53:6).  By the suffering of Christ on the cross everything between us and God is settled, and we are saved.  The breaking of the bread therefore is to bring to mind the doctrine of the Atonement.*
